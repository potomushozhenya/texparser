\textbf{Introduction.} There are three groups of methods for
simultaneous determination of the optical constants of the
material and the thickness of its layer. The first group is based
on the use of the Kramers---Kronig relations. In this case it is
only possible to measure the two parameters to determine the three
unknown [1, 2]. The missing equation is replaced by an integral
relation of the
\begin{gather*}
\varepsilon_1(\omega) = 1 + \dfrac1\pi\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty\dfrac{\varepsilon_2(x)}{x-\omega}dx,\\
\varepsilon_2(\omega) =   -
\dfrac1\pi\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty\dfrac{\varepsilon_1(x)-1}{x-\omega}dx,
\end{gather*}
where $\varepsilon_1(\omega)$ and $\varepsilon_2(\omega)$ --- the
real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity. In this case
formally you need to know the measured values in an infinite range
of wavelengths. However, due to known physical laws, it is
sufficient to carry out measurements in a limited, but
sufficiently wide spectral range. And then the obtained values are
extrapolated to infinite frequency values according to any
relatively simple law, for example, exponential law. Such methods
have been used in particular in [3]. We think that this method is
not satisfactory.

Indeed, real structures are adsorbed onto a substrate. Its optical
characteristics can not be assumed to be known in any broad
spectral range. Suffice it to say that a normal glass is
transparent in the wavelength range from 500 to 2700~nm, and in
the range of 360--500~nm absorption is significantly affected.
However, you can conditionally put a lower bound equal to 360~nm
or even lower it to 320~nm. The range of our interest is rather
narrow. It is also known that in the region less than 300~nm, most
materials have a complicated structure of the optical spectra.
This makes the extrapolation using some simple functions rather
doubtful.

The second group of methods is based on an approximation of the
refractive index depending on the wavelength by using any suitable
function, and further fitting the measured transmittance depending
on the wavelength to determine the refractive index [4]. In
practice, this group of methods does not provide a satisfactory
approach in any circumstances except for some numbers of
relatively studied materials, which only requires some fitting
(adjustment) of parameters to take into account the nuances of the
technological manufacturing.

The third group of methods is based on the measurement of any of
three values, depending on the optical constants of the
investigated film, which makes it possible to solve the
corresponding system of equations. In this case the choice of
measured values becomes relevant. It can be any available three
measurement values, for example, reflection from one surface at
three different angles. However, it seems to us that for practical
use the most suitable of these may be a reflection and
transmission coefficients from the substrate ($t_{-}$ and $r_{-}$,
respectively), and transmittance and reflection coefficients from
the free surface ($t_{+}$ and $r_{+}$, respectively):
%\begin{align*}
$$
t_- = \dfrac{E_+}{E} \dfrac{(1 - R_1)(1 - R_2)\exp(2\pi i d
N/\lambda)} {1 - R_1 R_2\exp(4\pi i d N/\lambda)},~~~
%$$ %\\
%$$
r_- = \dfrac{E_-}{E} \dfrac{(1 - R_1)^2 R_2} {1 - R_1 R_2\exp(4\pi
i d N/\lambda)} + R_1,
$$ %\\
$$
t_+ = \dfrac{(1 - R_1)(1 - R_2)\exp(2\pi i d N/\lambda)} {1 - R_1
R_2\exp(4\pi i d N/\lambda)},~~~
%$$ %\\
%$$
r_+ = \dfrac{(1 - R_2)^2 R_1} {1 - R_1 R_2\exp(4\pi i d
N/\lambda)} + R_2,
$$
%\end{align*}
\vskip 1mm\noindent where $E$ --- the amplitude of the wave
incident on the investigated film; $E_+$ --- the amplitude of a
wave incident on the film-substrate system; $E_-$ --- amplitude of
the wave passing sub-\linebreak strate-film system; $R_1$ ---
reflectance coefficient at the interface of the film and the
substrate under study; $R_2$
--- reflectance coefficient at the opposite edge of the film under
study; $d$ --- the thickness of the film; $\lambda$ ---
wavelength; $N$ --- complex index of refraction ($N = n - ik$, $n$
--- refractive coefficient, $k$ --- absorption coefficient,
$\varepsilon_1(\omega) = n^2 - k^2,\ \varepsilon_2(\omega) =
2nk$).

In is necessary to calculate the square of the corresponding
characteristics to calculate the values relating to the intensity.


It should be noted that used earlier formulas derived without
consideration of interference, of course, are absolutely incorrect
for most wavelengths, and further results of corresponding papers
will not be considered [5]. The advantage of such expressions is
their simplicity that makes possible the calculations without the
use of a computer, but now the computer problem is absent.

The direct task of calculating these three values is not
difficult. The situation is different with the inverse task ---
calculation of optical parameters included in the formulas using
the measured values. Particular difficulties is that the accuracy
of measurement of these values in the real case is small --- less
than 5\%, it can be estimated slightly higher for transmittance
measuring --- about 3\%.

Despite the high accuracy inherent to optical methods in the
measurement of geometric quantities and timing (frequency)
characteristics, achieving better results for photometry seems
either very difficult (which leads to the growth of these tasks in
an independent scientific problem) or even impossible (due to
technological limitations in the hardware). Therefore, generally
speaking, an attempt to direct joint solution of equations may
fail, even though the physical absurdity of this situation is
obvious. As stated in [6], even small errors in transmittance or
reflection measurements can lead to large errors in the
determination of optical constants, which in turn leads to a
completely erroneous calculation of the distribution of optical
excitation of the thickness. Dependences of the observed values of
the thin film optical parameters are very complex, which makes the
traditional way to solve this problem unacceptable --- Figure~1.

\textbf{1. Generalized target model function.} The extended
solution understanding in the sense of least squares method was
chosen to overcome the above difficulty. In this case a
generalized target function is formed [7]:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:target-one}
A(n,k,d)= W_1\left(1 - \dfrac{R_1}{R_{1t}}\right)^2 + W_2\left(1 -
\dfrac{R_2}{R_{2t}}\right)^2 + W_3\left(1 -
\dfrac{T}{T_{t}}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
here $R_{1t}$ --- the theoretical value of the reflection of free
surface of the film; $R_{2t}$ --- the theoretical value of the
reflection of surface adjacent to the substrate; $T_t$ ---
transmittance as a function of the unknown quantities $n$, $k$ and
$d$; $R_1$, $R_2$ and $T$ --- their measured values. The
coefficients $W_1$, $W_2$ and $W_3$ in \eqref{eq:target-one} are
weighting factors. If the measured values are absolutely accurate
and solution of possible a minimum value of $A$ is 0. However,
even in this case, the solution may be non-unique, i.~e. the task
is not correct according to Hadamard. In the real case of finite
measurement errors the purpose of the procedure is to minimize the
target function $A$.


What is the reason for this choice of the target function form?
Three factors should be mentioned that have made this choice the
best in our opinion. RMS value is accepted because it allows you
to use powerful statistical evaluation $\chi^2$ criteria such as
hypotheses. Inclusion into the target function of the absolute
deviations of measured values is not appropriate, as they may vary
by one to two orders of magnitude by varying the wavelength of the
probe radiation. These values can differ from each other by one
order, in which case one of the measured values simply does not
affect the result. Whereas the relative error of the measurement
of these values lies in the same order. Finally, the weighting
factors $W_i$ allow to take into account different measurement
accuracy, respectively, a different effect on the selection of the
different values test parameters. These factors were chosen
inversely proportional to the relative measurement error. In
contrast weighting factors selection when determining the average
value their absolute value, of course, does not play any role. In
practice, they were chosen to be respectively 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0.

With the proposed method, instead of solving a system of three
transcendental equations with three unknowns, the problem was
reduced to finding the extremum of a function of three variables.
The first numerical experiments show that this function is
multiextremal. One of the reasons of multiextremality was the
possibility of interference of light beams in thin layers.
Standard methods such as steepest descent led to endless loop
process at one of the local extrema. Such ambiguity of the
solution was repeatedly discussed in the literature on the
definition of the optical constants of the layers, and gave rise
to the widespread use of one of the methods of the first group
(with the use of the Kramers---Kronig relations).

In general, the search for the extremum of multiextremal functions
in multi-\linebreak dimensional space is an extremely difficult
task [8]. Existing strategies of search does not provide any
reliable guarantees finding the global extreme. From a practical
point of view, proposed in a number of papers the method of step
global exhaustive search selection using the Lipschitz condition
is absolutely useless. It reduces the main problem to the solution
of the auxiliary task of finding the maximum of the derivative in
the same multidimensional space. In this case is necessary to
carry out the operation of differentiation, which is a problem in
itself and may lead to additional errors.

From a theoretical point of view, this case is a classic example
of incorrect task, as it has more than one solution. It seems to
us that the use of the criterion of minimum complexity of the
model in this case is not sufficiently effective as a comparison
of functionals
\begin{equation*} %\label{eq:minmax-two}
\Omega(n,k,d) = \int\limits_{\min}^{\max}\left[
A^2(n,k,d)+{A'}^2(n,k,d)\right] ds
\end{equation*}
does not provide statistically significant differences for
different sets of variables $\{n, k, d\}$ under the condition of
low measurement accuracy, not to mention the mentioned derivative
computation difficulties.


%\medskip
\textbf{2. Algorithms for determining the parameters of thin
film.} In a particular application, we can use a redefinition of
the task, if not mathematically, in the physical sense of the
word. Indeed, the target function $A$ is among others dependent on
the wavelength $\lambda$, as well as the optical parameters $n$
and $k$ of material. In addition to the obvious requirement of the
existence of a target function extremum for some values of the
variables, it is possible to impose the condition of continuity of
optical parameters with respect to wavelength. Since the required
variables $n$, $k$, and $d$ are physical quantities, it can be
said that in the linear approximation
\vspace*{-2mm}\begin{equation*} %\label{eq:opt-three}
    \begin{array}{c}
        n(\lambda +\Delta\lambda) = n(\lambda) + \dfrac{dn}{d\lambda}\Delta\lambda,%\\[9pt]
        \,\,\,k(\lambda +\Delta\lambda) = k(\lambda) + \dfrac{dk}{d\lambda}\Delta\lambda,\\%[9pt]
        d(\lambda +\Delta\lambda) = d(\lambda) + \dfrac{dd}{d\lambda}\Delta\lambda = d(\lambda)
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
(it is obvious that the film thickness does not depend on the
measurement conditions). Carrying out measurements at different
wavelengths $\lambda_i$, we are able to reject solutions which
lead to discontinuous functions of $n$ and $k$. An additional
criterion for the correctness of the decision may serve the
Student's \textit{t}-test. Calculating the $l$ values of $d$
denote them as $\{d_i\}$ on all available wavelengths $l$. Define
the $m$ values of sample means $\bar{d}_m$ and variances $s_m^2$
according to the rule
\vspace*{-2mm}\begin{equation*} %\label{eq:four}
%    \begin{array}{l}
        \bar{d}_m =\dfrac{1}{l-1} \sum\limits_{i\neq
        m}^{l}d_i,\,\,\,
        s_m^2     =\dfrac{1}{l-2} \sum\limits_{i\neq k}^{l} (d_i - \bar{d}_m)^2,
%    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
and, using Student's criterion, we obtain that if for all $m$
\vspace*{-1mm}\begin{equation}\label{eq:five} \dfrac{\bar{d}_m -
d_m}{s_m} < t_{l-2,\;0.95},
\end{equation}
then this set of solutions corresponds to a confidence level of
95\% of the assumption of the constancy of $d$. Sets contradicting
this condition should be omitted. This procedure is quite correct
[9], but too time-consuming and leads to the calculation of a
large number of false choices. Therefore, this procedure has been
improved for practical implementation.

In the first stage there is no a priori information (except for
general physical {conside\-rations}, i.~e. reduced to physically
thinkable restrictions on the values) to estimate all the unknown
variables. And all thinkable space of values, i.~e. 1.3--4.0 for
$n$, 0.0--4.0 for $k$, and 10--100~nm for $d$ is divided into
intervals in steps of 0.1, 0.05 and 5, respectively. Minimum is
searched around each of the initial values by the
Fletcher---Reeves method [10], which is a modified method of
steepest descent. In this case, the direction of the target
function gradient (discrete components 0.1 for $n$ and the $k$,
5~nm to $d$) is determined in each initial point, a few steps done
in the direction against the gradient until reaching a minimum
value, the gradient is again determined, and the procedure is
repeated. If the initial step selected for the calculations led to
a cycle, i.~e. determining the position of the extremum of target
function with an accuracy of the value of this step, the step
value is reduced by an order, and the steepest descent procedure
is continued again. When the program goes in cycle with step
reduced by two orders of magnitude, the program is stopped, and
the resulting values of variables are considered relevant to a
target function local minimum. The accuracy of calculation is to
be about 0.001 for $n$ and $k$, and 0.05~nm for $d$, considerably
exceeding the accuracy because of measurement errors.


As a result of the first stage the program forms an array of 1000
values of variables $\{A_{ilm}\}$ meeting the target function
minimum obtained for some initial point $n_i$, $k_l$, $d_m$. If
there is only one (global) extremum, these values are identical up
to the value of the order of the last step.

The target function is multiextremal, therefore, although many
initial values of the {va\-riables} lead to the same extremum,
variable values selection variants yet proved quite a lot. From
these values were rejected those that correspond to the nonglobal
extrema, i.~e. those in which the target function more than twice
obtained for other initial values. Typically, after the rejection
there was three to six sets $\{n_i, k_i, d_i\}$ statistically
different from each other.

In the following stage, i.~e. at other wavelengths there is no
need to investigate the extremum of all physically possible values
of the variables. Due to the continuity of the functions
$n(\lambda), k(\lambda)$ and the constancy of $d$ as the initial
sets we selected sets $\{n_i, k_i, d_i\}$ defined in the first
stage. And the steepest descent procedure repeats as described
previously. For each of the following wavelength values, the same
procedure is repeated. After four or five of such procedures, the
first test of Student criterion was performed. If it turns out
that \eqref{eq:five} is violated, the corresponding chain broke
off, and further calculations with given initial values of the
parameters were not fulfilled. As a rule, after the calculations
for six to eight wavelengths only one solution left.

With this algorithm run time is significantly reduced. Algorithms
of programs are shown in Figure~2, \textit{I--III}.

Selection of the wavelength of the initial values is very
significant, because the initial value of the wavelength can be
selected arbitrarily by researcher.

It is possible that from the standpoint of eliminating random
measurement errors, randomized wavelength selection would have
been more effective, but we are deprived of the  possibility of
using the continuity of the functional dependence of the optical
parameters of the material on the wavelength. As it turns out,
more stable solutions can be obtained\linebreak

\noindent at the initial point corresponding to the minimum
transmittance that is in the short wavelengths. This is natural,
since in this case the interference effects play a much smaller
role. For very large values of the absorption coefficient the
variation of intensity of the light field becomes almost
exponential, and the solution is quite stable.

\textbf{Conclusion.} The proposed algorithms were used to
calculate the characteristics of the compounds intensively used in
the photoelectronic devices, namely multi-alkali photocathode,
which is a complex compound having in its composition antimonides
of potassium, sodium and cesium. As in other cases, the optical
properties play an important role in the functioning of devices,
while the differences in the optical constants determined this
compound are sufficiently large, even if the determination is made
in the same laboratory. This is natural, considering that the
process of manufacturing this compound comprises up to 30
operations only on the last stage of the vacuum treatment. Our
results are presented in
Figures~3, %5

rather\linebreak%\newpage

material near the intrinsic absorption edge. When compared with
the data given in the literature, our sample absorption
coefficient is significantly greater. Compared to modern data  the
 value of $k$ in our samples is noteworthy smaller, especially in
the near infrared region of the spectrum. Performed ``reverse''
calculation (the total absorption of the known optical constants)
shows that the samples provided to us have about half the
absorption of light, and therefore, may not have as high a
sensitivity as described in [11]. Increase in thickness, which
also leads to an increase in absorption, it is not sufficiently
effective, especially from the standpoint of electrons output in a
vacuum, since increased thickness causes an increase in power loss
at the stage of transportation.
