{\leftskip=7mm\noindent Nowadays, one of the most urgent tasks facing
the state authorities in the Russian Federation is to manage
the comprehensive development of the regions. The complexity
of this subject to management, multidimensionality of existing problems and
the inconsistency of the targets in conjunction with the dynamically
changing operating conditions require the use of modern methods and tools
to forecasting of changes in the key parameters of regional development.
The article describes approach to the formation of an adaptive simulation model
of regional socio-economic system. This model allows to take into account
the behaviour of economic agents in their interaction with each other and
the environment. The conceptual scheme of this model is presented.
The basic elements of model, including blocks of adaptive behaviour of agents,
use of resources and maintenance of balances are revealed. The control subsystem
including the goal setting and control blocks is allocated separately.
A set of rules governing the activation of a particular block of the model
is justified. To implement this task, the adjustment mechanism
of the indicative plan is formalized based on fuzzy logic methods.
The knowledge base of fuzzy rules for the formation of target indicators
for management of the regional system development is developed. At the end
of the article the scheme of implementation of information support
of regional development management based on the proposed adaptive simulation

{\bf Introduction.} Currently, strategic objective of access to an
innovative development model for the regions of Russia requires
large-scale implementation of advanced technology and notation
that provide access to a new techno-economic paradigm based on
production of goods and services with higher value added nowadays.
An equally important objective is formation immediately
innovation-oriented system of strategic planning that could ensure
the integration of potential innovate centers inside the existing
exceptionally inertial model of the reproduction process.
Moreover, this system could analyze impact of innovation factors
on the development of economic system, mutual adapt and
synchronize these processes within the framework horizon for
strategic planning [1].

Accordingly, the issues of the development approaches to
forecasting and planning of the regional development that consider
these features become update [2]. Currently, the solution of this
problem is associated with several difficulties --- nonconcurrence
of objectives (by levels, planning horizon and subjects of
management), the deficient consistency of the existing economic
policies, the lack of a clear analysis system and an efficient use
of management information, the immaturity of methodical aspects of
strategic planning at the regional level. As a result, there is a
low quality of the formed forecast estimates for the main
parameters of regional development [3], which necessitate for its
constant revision during the implementation of strategies.

Within this framework further development of methods of strategic
planning at the regional level requires qualitative rethinking
that dictated by the need to consider continuous changes of the
parameters and the condition in a global competitive market
environment, and its impact on the economic growth. The formation
of regional de\-ve\-lop\-ment programs even in the medium term
requires the implementation of mechanisms for mutual consideration
of the interests and adaptation of economic agents' behaviour
strategies on the different levels, the existence of prior
agreement procedures, and then joint implementation, the
monitoring and iteration correcting of the strategic parameters of
territorial development [4]. In this context, the modern decision
support technologies based on the adaptive management technique
and simulation modelling can be an effective tool for the
improvement methods of strategic planning [5]. These technologies
allow to ensure of the qualitative information support in
development and implementation of the regional economic
development programmes.

{\bf A conceptual framework of the regional development
modelling.} The strategy of socio-economic development of the
regional system includes a set of indicators (indicative plan)
which describe the desired state of the system in the future, and
control parameters implementation of which is aims to achieve the
indicative plan. One of the main issues of development strategy is
to define of the balance of interests of the key economic agents
(EA). The use of management models and mechanisms seems
appropriate as a tool for solving such problems [6, 7]. This
toolkit should be capable of the forecasting evolutionary
processes in the regional economic system in a changing of
domestic and external macroenvironment, in other words it is based
on the use of an adaptive method.

The proposed conception of an Adaptive Simulation Modelling (ASM)
is based on the idea of the eventual adaptation of both the agent
behavior strategies and the controlling action to changes in the
economic environment. This conception of ASM comprises three main
levels: the EA, the regional management, the macroenvironment
(Figure 1) [8]. Regarding to the problem solution of development
programs for the regional growth, regional economic actors are one
of many EA, but it differs from other agents of the model by set
of characteristics and goals inherent in them. Consequently,
implementation of the functions to manage the innovative
development of the region is to establish a certain condition for
their activities and realized by the central and local public
authorities of a region.

\end{figure}



A set of models of the EA describes by the tuple:
\begin{equation*}
A=\left\langle MS,MF,MX\right\rangle,
\end{equation*}
here $MS$ is the block of adaptive behavior of the EA, $MF$ is the
block of resources use by the EA, $MX$ is the block of balancing
income and expenditures of the EA.


Particularly, the block of EA adaptive behavior $MS=\left\langle
R_a,S_r,K,Y^f\right\rangle $ describes the actions of EA on the
use available at its disposal resources $
R_a=\lbrace{R_a}^1_t,{R_a}^2_t,\dots,{R_a}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ in
order to achieve $ Y^f=\lbrace
Y^{f_1}_t,Y^{f_2}_t,\dots,Y^{fn_k}_t\rbrace$ in accordance a
certain behavior strategy $
S_r=\lbrace{S_r}^1_t,{S_r}^2_t,\dots,{S_r}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ based
on the current grade of situation $K=\lbrace
K^1_t,K^2_t,\dots,K^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ at the time $t$
($t=1,2,\dots,T$, where $T$ is the modelling horizon). Hereinafter
$n_k$ is the number of elements, which include in the $k$-th
tuple.

Adaptability of the agent behavior to changing operational
conditions (by choosing of another behavior strategy which is a
set of rules implemented in these conditions) is a distinctive
feature of the considered block.

The block of resources $MF$ describes the changes in inventories
of the EA $St=\lbrace{St}^1_t,\\ {St}^2_t,
\dots,{St}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ and its flows $Fl=\lbrace
Fl^1_t,Fl^2_t,\dots,Fl^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ at some instant $t$.
Consequently, in our opinion, the use of models and methods of
system dynamics as the prime tool is the most appropriate in
forming a model. The block of balance analysis $MX$ ensures
maintenance of the expenditure $Out=\lbrace
Out^1_t,Out^2_t,\dots,Out^{n_k}_t\rbrace$  on a level determined
by the income and resources of the economic agent.

As shown on Figure 1, the control subsystem is represented by
second level of the hie\-rarchy and forms a model of regional
management $U$ which includes two interrelated blocks~--- goal
setting (establishment of the indicative development plan of the
RSES) and regulation (formation of the control parameters that
ensure the achievement of the indicative plan) which are presented
in Figure 2. The choice of the solution is based on the analysis
of the level of achievement of the planned values of indicators of
regional socio-economic development and the availability of unused
system resources (Table 1). The solution numbers in the Table 1
correspond to the solution numbers in Figure 2.

Within the framework of this model the solution of economic
development issues at regional level is expected among other
things.

Assessment of resources of the EA ``State'' ($Gr^s_t$) occurs when
choosing solutions ((2) and (3)). From there, the decision to
change the expenditure either on the minimum achieved, or on a
predetermined (for example, the tasks of social development)
direction of development at the expense of state resources
($OutG\_Y_\textrm{min}$ and $OutG\_Y_\textrm{soc}$ respectively)
or business resources ($OutB\_Y_\textrm{min}$ and
$OutB\_Y_\textrm{soc}$) is taken.

The peculiarity of regional management decisions is to describe
these procedures with the help of such fuzzy formulations as
``slightly'', ``essential'', etc. A few researchers note that part
of the scenario conditions can be based on expert assessments [9].
It is proposed to use the algorithm of a fuzzy logic $FzL$ for
implementing this approach within the framework of the developed
tools which is a distinctive feature of the goal-setting block
$Z_0$. This block $Z_0$ provides determination and correction of
the indicative plan
$Y^{Id}=\lbrace{Y_t}^{Id1},{Y_t}^{Id2},\dots,{Y_t}^{Idn_k}\rbrace$
in time $t$:
\begin{equation*}
\label{Z0} Z_0=\left\langle Y^f,FzL,Y^{Id}\right\rangle.
\end{equation*}

The original version of the indicative plan $Y^{Id}_t$ is formed
by the decision maker in view of the current situation, trends in
the development of both internal and external environment, as well
as considering the development goals of the RSES. Within the
framework of the regulation block $Rg$ setting the regulators of
the controlling system $Reg=\lbrace Reg^1_t, Reg^2_t,\dots,
Reg^{n_k}_t\rbrace $ are configured based on the set development
goals and available resources, while monitoring the key
macroindicators $Y^f_t$ at the instant of time~$t$:
\begin{equation*}
\label{Rg} Rg=\left\langle Y^f,Y^{Id},Gr,Reg\right\rangle.
\end{equation*}

Consequently, management of RSES includes value determination of
the indicative plan which is a quantification of the of the
regional development goals and ways to achieve them. The balance
block SAM describes by the tuple $SAM=\left\langle
D,S\right\rangle $, where $D$ and $S$ represent, respectively, the
demand and supply of resources in the markets.

The model of macroenvironment $H=\left\langle
Sn,Rh,Sc\right\rangle $ is defined through the parameters
$Sn=\lbrace {Sn}^1_t,{Sn}^2_t,\dots,{Sn}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$ and
resources $Rh=\lbrace {Rh}^1_t,{Rh}^2_t,\dots,{Rh}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$
of external environment, defined by scenario card $Sc$ for each
time $t$.  To be noticed is that the model of regional system can
be obtained predictive estimates only those parameters that
characterize the ele\-ments of system. Accordingly, all
characteristics of the macroenvironment are exogenous parameters
of the model. When determining their numerical values, it is
advisable to focus on the forecasts developed by the Ministry of
Economic Development of the Russian Federation. The formation of
scenario maps is based on the scenario conditions used in this
case.

The modelling process is based on the nesting of calculations.
This procedure includes consistent calculation of $i$-th ($\forall
i, i=\overline{1;i_k}$, where $i_k$ is a number of parameters in
the indicative plan) element $Y^{Idi}_t$ within the framework the
nested procedure for calculating the $ij$-th~com\-bi\-na\-tion
$reg^{ig}_t$ ($\forall j, j=\overline{1;j_k}$, where $j_k$ is a
number of controlled parameters) simulating the adaptive behavior
of the EA $A$. The decision to change the parameter values
$reg^{ig}_t$, $Y^{Idi}_t$ or move to the next model period $(t+1)$
is made based on the degree of achievement of the target indicator
$Y^{Idi}_t$.

In this way, the proposed conception of an adaptive simulation
modelling for a region is based on the hierarchical
interconnection of the triad of models in a single computable
complex. This makes it possible to implement an iterative
mechanism of mutual adaptation of interests and strategies of the
EA both in interaction with each other and in interaction with the
management system in the process of development and implementation
of regional development programs.

{\bf Formalization of the mechanism for adjusting the indicative
plan involving the use methods of fuzzy logic.} The developed
approach to modelling of the procedure for adjusting the
indicative development plan of the RSES is based on the use of
fuzzy logic, which determines the sequence of stages as described
below. The indicative plan in this context must include key
indicators of socio-economic development of the region such as
gross regional product, volume of fixed investment, the amount of
per capita income, the amount of fiscal capacity, etc.

At the stage of fuzzification used conditions are expressed in the
form of linguistic term. The solutions themselves are formed using
the following criterion:

\emph{Criterion 1}. Degree of indicative plan achievement is
${PD}^i_t=\lbrace {PD}^1_t,{PD}^2_t,\dots,{PD}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$.
Linguistic variable ${PD}^i_t$ can take values $
{PD}^i_t=\lbrace$\emph{overfulfilled (pd); achieved (d); not
achieved (nd)}$\rbrace$.

\emph{Criterion 2}. The change in the rate of growth of element
$i$ of the indicative plan is  ${TRP}^i_t=\lbrace
{TRP}^1_t,{TRP}^2_t,\dots,
{TRP}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$~characterizing~its~dynamics. The possible
value of linguistic variable is ${TRP}^i_t=\lbrace$\emph{improved
considerably (mv); improved (v); remained  intact (s);  revised
down (n); revised down considerably (mn)}$\rbrace$.

\emph{Criterion 3}. Ratio of growth rate element $i$ of the
indicative plan and growth rates of other indicators
${RPd}^i_t=\lbrace
{RPd}^1_t,{RPd}^2_t,\dots,{RPd}^{n_k}_t\rbrace$. Linguistic
variable ${RPd}^i_t$ can take values
${RPd}^i_t=\lbrace$\emph{significantly higher (mv); higher (v);
comparable (s); below (n); far below (mn)}$\rbrace$.

\emph{Criterion 4}. Availability of other indicators with the best
growth rates.

The membership functions have been developed for fuzzification of
the distinct reported value. It should be noted that type of these
functions may vary for different regional systems. The membership
function of class $L(x;a,b)$ applied to describe the leftmost term
of the study. The membership function of class $t(x;a,b,c)$
employed to describe the middle term.  The membership function of
class $\gamma(x;a,b)$ was used to describe the far-right term.
These functions are standard membership functions that are easily
applicable to most tasks. The choice of these functions is
contingent on the analysis of the subject area considering the
scientific assessment. The values of the coefficients $a, b, c$
are determined individually for each element under study.

Thus, to describe the leftmost term, apply the expression:
\begin{equation*}
\mu(a,b,c)=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if $x\leq a$}, \\ \frac{b-x}{b-a}, & \text{if $x<b$}, \\
0, & \text{if $x\geq b$}.
\end{cases} \
\end{equation*}

To describe the middle term, apply the expression:
\begin{equation*}
\mu(x,a,b,c)=
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if $x\leq a$}, \\ \frac{x-a}{c-a}, & \text{if $a<x\leq c$}, \\\frac{b-x}{b-c}, & \text{if $c<x<b$}, \\
0, & \text{if $x\geq b$}.
\end{cases} \
\end{equation*}

To describe the far-right term, apply the expression:
\begin{equation*}
\mu(x,a,b)=
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if $x\leq a$}, \\ \frac{x-a}{b-a}, & \text{if $x<b$}, \\
1, & \text{if $x\geq b$}.
\end{cases} \
\end{equation*}

The calculated values of the criteria determine the fuzzy solution
${Resh}^i_t=\lbrace {Resh}^1_t,$\linebreak ${Resh}^2_t, \dots,
{Resh}^n_t \rbrace$ that describes the change of the $i$-th
element of the indicative plan. Accordingly, linguistic variable
${Resh}^i_t$ for each indicators of the indicative plan can take
values ${Resh}^i_t=\lbrace$\emph{significantly reduce (mn); reduce
(n); save current value (s); raise (v); significantly raise
(mv)}$\rbrace$.

The formation of a fuzzy knowledge base is the next step. The
system of fuzzy statement is written as
\begin{equation*}
\bar{L}=
\begin{cases}
\bar{L_1}:< \text{if $\bar{A_1}$, then $\bar{B_1}$}>, \\ \dotso, \\
\bar{L_m}:<\text{if $\bar{A_m}$, then $\bar{B_m}$}>.
\end{cases} \
\end{equation*}

Fuzzy statements correspond to the general form as
\begin{equation*}
\label{Aj} \bar{A_j}:< \text{$\beta_{w}$ is $\alpha_{wj}$}>
\text{and $\bar{B_j}$}:<\bar{\beta_v}\ \text {is $\alpha_{vj}$}>,
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha_{wj}$, $\alpha_{vj}$ are values of terms of input
and output linguistic variable; $\beta_w$, $\beta_v$  are  the
terms of input and output linguistic variables.\pagebreak

Knowledge base formed based on the selected criteria and analysis
of the subject area. The choice of a fuzzy decision ${Resh}^i_t $
on the change of the indicative plan implemented based on
knowledge base (Table 2).

The final step is the defuzzification procedure which is necessary
to determine the specific numerical value of the output parameter.
Various methods (``center of gravity'', ``first maximum'',
``middle maximum'' and others) can be used for this purpose [10].
The study used the method of ``first maximum'' characterized by
simplicity of implementation. However, this approach has a few
disadvantages. Slow response in terms of fuzzy model is the most
significant of them. One area for further research, in our
opinion, is the rationale using of the center of gravity method to
solve the problem, considering the existing features of the
membership function of the output parameter. Next, the truth value
of each rule is calculated, and a management decision is formed.

The achievement of the indicative plan $Y^{Id}_t$ is carried out
by changing the values of the controlled parameters ${reg}^{iy}_t$
in accordance with the selected rules ${Ru}^s_t$, which are a
record of the form: ``if ${Ru}^s_t=true$, then
${reg}^j_t={reg}^j_t+\gamma^j$''. A key principle of development
control parameters is levelling and maximizing the degree of
achievement of indicators (min~$(Y^{fi}_t / Y^{Idi}_t)
\longrightarrow$~max). At each modeling step, one of the
situations that define the rules ${Ru}^s_t$ is possible:\\
% \begin{enumerate}[1)]

(Y^{fi}_t\geq Y^{Idi}_t)\wedge

The value $\lambda^j$ for adjusting the values of the regulators
is determined by a decision maker, and for adjusting the
parameters of the indicative plan is using the fuzzy algorithm
described above.

In this way, the control block ensures the transfer of the RSES
from the current state to the specified one in accordance with the
formed indicative plan. As a result of step $q$ of the iterative
algorithm either the reallocation of the resource and the
introduction of a new control action, or a return to the level of
goal is setting-options 1 and 6.

At the same time, attention should be paid to boundaries of the
use of the proposed models and algorithms. This issue is
multidimensional. In particular, the proposed models do not
consider the microeconomic parameters, the indicators of
development of municipalities that are part of the regional
system. There is a limit associated with the level of detail.
Similarly, as has been noted above the parameters of the
macroenvironment are exogenous in the model. On the other side,
the results obtained in the course of model experiments, one way
or another, are based on the economic laws laid down in the model,
the existing conditions, and some assumptions. In this regard,
with a qualitative change in the state of the regional environment
or the conditions for the functioning of agents, a more detailed
analysis of their consequences is required. The final decision on
the implementation of certain public policy measures should be
based on the opinion of the decision-maker.

Development of regional ASM based on the proposed modeling concept
can be used as the core of various information systems. The use of
these information systems is aimed at solving the problem of
providing quality information support in the implementation of
development programs at the regional level. The development of the
decision support system is the most perspective and
fit-for-purpose [11, 12].

{\bf Scheme of implementation of information support based on
ASM.} In general terms, the decision support system in regional
development management, in our opinion, should solve the following
basic tasks:

--- collection and accumulation of factual information, structured
information in the form of decision rules, as well as
semi-structured information in the form of ontologies and
precedents;

--- situation analysis using problem-oriented knowledge base with
inference mechanism [13];

--- formation of the forecast of situation in different
macroeconomic conditions based on adaptive simulation model;

--- development of a set of recommendations for the formation and
correcting of the parameters of regional development management.


However, the proposed adaptive-simulation model does not allow to
solve the problems of information and analytical support and
requires the addition of a set of functional blocks (Figure 3).

Phase 1 is the formation of a set of initial parameters. A data
entry block provides filling the database with various information
about the state of the control object and the environment. In view
of the fact that database should be updated periodically,
organization of monitoring is a necessary condition for DSS
functioning.  This makes it possible allows not only have an idea
of the current and retrospective state of the control object, but
also to monitor the consequences of management decisions, and
accordingly to expand and improve the existing bases of rules and
precedents. Processing enormous aggregation of information
requires the use of modern information technology data processing
and data mining. As a consequence, data storage is proposed to be
organized on the basis of the OLAP concept (including through the
multidimensional database properties) and Data Mining. According
to experts in this field using Data Mining can look for insights
in large amounts of information [14].

In addition, the input block is used to mission statement by the
system user (decision maker) [15]. This phase is represented by
the task formation block (see Figure 3). The need for this block
is contingent on variety of practical tasks and areas of
application of the DSS and the need to enter not only reporting
data, but also exogenous parameters of the model, as well as the
choice of development strategy. The block of strategy formation
should allow to develop the general strategy of regional system
development and to define a number of parameters of model even
before simulation for a choice of the development direction.

Obtained the forecast and planning estimates pass to block of
analysis and iden\-ti\-fi\-ca\-tion of problems. At this stage,
cross-section analysis, analysis of trends and other procedures
are carried out. These procedures allow to identify both the
problems and the prerequisites for their occurrence. The base of
precedents is used for this purpose. It con\-tains information
about the possibility of using the accumulated experience of
solving problems in the process of developing solutions to new
tasks. Decision support system forms a set of alternative
solutions based on the forecast-planned estimates identified in
the analysis of development problems. The implementation of this
procedure is expected to be carried out within the solutions
formation block that allows for the classification of situations
and comparison with the existing base of precedents to select
possible solutions based on the algorithm presented in Figure 2.
The use of methods of fuzzy logic theory seems appropriate as a
tool for solving such problems. This approach makes it possible to
monitor the smooth variation in the properties of the control
object, as well as to use its qualitative characteristics [16].

Integration of the proposed DSS based on adaptive simulation model
of the region, into the activities of regional ministries and
departments involves the solution of a number of issues. In
particular, it is necessary to clearly define the stages of
formulation of the strategic development documents, which use the
capabilities of this tool. Methodological recommendations for
their implementation, taking into account the use of the DSS,
should be developed (or adjusted) for each of the stages. Within
the framework of these recommendations, it is necessary to clearly
define the list and characteristics of the used indicators, the
frequency of data updates, the sources of information, the issues
of coordination with other stakeholders. Based on this, a list of
officials is determined, and their powers are adjusted
accordingly. In addition, it is recommended to identify a focal
point responsible for the implementation of the proposed system,
as well as the procedure for evaluating and monitoring the
effectiveness of its implementation.

Generally, the proposed DSS can become a universal tool that
provides the decision maker necessary for decision-making
information about the retrospective, current and future state of
the regional socio-economic system. Also, this tool will allow to
analyze and identify possible ways to solve the existing problems.

{\bf Conclusion.} Thus, within the framework of the study, a
conceptual scheme for the implementation of the DSS in the field
of regional development management is proposed. Also, the place of
the adaptive simulation model in the structure of the system is
determined, potential for use adaptive simulation model in the
formation of forecast-planned estimates of the region's
development are shown, as well as the assessment of feasibility of
alternative control actions are shown. The article describes the
procedure of forming the solution and the purpose of functional
blocks. This tool provides the ability to work with a model
complex for the end costumer, providing convenient use of tools
for a person who is not an expert in economics and mathematical
modeling [17].

From a theoretical perspective, the proposed tools will expand the
possibilities of combination both management theory and decision
support methods, intellectual information technologies, and
economic and mathematical methods, modern computer simulation
technologies for strategic planning of the socio-economic systems
development on macro- and meso-level. The software tools have an
important practical focus. The proposed design of the decision
support system can be used by public authorities for determining
the parameters of the medium-term development in the regions of
the Russian Federation, as well as other RSES in the development
of measures and mechanisms for the implementation of state
economic policy.
