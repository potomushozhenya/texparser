{\bf 1. Introduction.} Volterra integral equations have many
useful applications in describing numerous applied problems and
events of the real world.  Nowadays, the theory of numerical
treatment of the second kind Volterra equations is fairly
well-developed, and historical surveys on this topic as well as an
extended bibliography can be found in the monographs [1--4].
Methods for solving first kind Volterra equations so far have been
justified only for some special cases, for example, for linear
equations with a kernel that does not vanish on the diagonal for
all points of the segment. Many research papers address this type
of problems, which are widely covered in the monographs listed
above, as well as in [5--8].

This paper considers linear systems of Volterra equations with a
singular square matrix multiplying the leading part. Such systems
are commonly referred to as integral algebraic equations (IAEs)
and generally have the form

\begin{equation}\label{eq_1}
A(t)x(t)+\int\limits_{0}^{t}K(t,s)x(s)ds = f(t), \ ~ ~  0 \le s
\le t \le 1,
\end{equation}
where $A(t),~ K(t,s)$ are $n\times  n$ matrices, $f(t)$ and $x(t)$
are the given and the desired vector-functions, respectively. It
is assumed that the elements of  $A(t), K(t,s), f(t)$ are
sufficiently smooth and
\begin{equation}\label{eq_2}
\det A(t) \equiv  0.
\end{equation}

Here by the solution of the problem \eqref{eq_1}, \eqref{eq_2}, we
understand any continuous vector-function  $x(t)$ that turns
\eqref{eq_1} into an identity. Note that if $n=1$, we obtain the
first kind Volterra equation.

Integral algebraic equations naturally arise in many mathematical
modeling processes, e.~g. the kernel identification problems in
heat conduction and viscoelasticity [9], evolution of a chemical
reaction within a small cell [10], the two dimensional biharmonic
equation in a semi-infinite strip [11], dynamic processes in
chemical reactors [12] and Kirchhoff's laws [1] (for further
applications see [1, 13] and references therein).

The first papers on the qualitative and numerical analysis of IAEs
were published in the end of 1980s. Drawing on the available
literature, it appears that the first paper addressing IAEs was
[14], followed later by [15].  However, by present time there have
been published no more than 30 papers addressing numerical
treatment of such problems. The majority of papers considers IAEs
of the semi-explicit form and employ for their solution
collocation type methods. The polynomial spline collocation method
and its convergence results were studied in [16].  In [17], the
authors presented the Jacobi collocation method including the
matrix-vector multiplication representation for IAEs of index-2. A
posteriori error estimation is also obtained for the Legendre
collocation method in [18]. These methods were extended to the
semi-explicit IAEs of indices 1 and 2, as well as to the IAEs with
weakly singular kernels in [19]. A multistep method based on the
Adams quadrature rules and extrapolation formulas was constructed
in [20]. An approach based on the block pulse functions was
proposed in [21]. The paper [22] proposes a regularization method
for linear IAEs. Recent studies can be found in the works [12,
23], which present an analysis of piecewise polynomial collocation
solutions for general systems of linear IAEs based on the notions
of the tractability index and the $\nu$-smoothing property by
decoupling the system into the inherent system of regular Volterra
integral equations.

Actually, most of the numerical methods discussed so far, have
been the projection-based approach. The  main issue with IAEs is
that they explicitly or implicitly comprise Volterra equations of
the first kind which causes these equations to belong to the class
of moderately ill-posed problems. However, owing to some
restrictive conditions as well as instability of  numerical
differentiation, the reduction of the problem to the regular
system of  second kind Volterra equations may not be always
practical from a numerical point of view.

Another difficulty is related to the high computational complexity
of the projection based methods, since the associated projectors
onto the null spaces have to be computed at every integration
step, which makes the numerical approach rather expensive.

Following [4], the application of some higher order multistep
methods to this type of  equations may also result in unstable
processes. This means that algorithms based on the Adams, Simpson
and Newton---Cotes formulas might be unstable, when applied to
IAEs.


%\end{example}

The aim of the current research is to address the instability issues of the numerical methods and propose the techniques for handling them.  The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we discuss some useful tools for theoretical analysis. Section 3 provides a general idea of a stable algorithm for IAEs \eqref{eq_1}, whereas section 4 presents stable second and third order methods together with results of numerical experiments on some test problems. %Section 5 is conclusions.

{\bf 2. Preliminaries and some useful lemmas.} Below, we will need
the following statements and definitions.

{\bf Definition 1} {[24]}{\bf .} {\it  The matrix pencil $\lambda
A(t)+B(t)$ satisfies the rank-degree criterion on the segment $\
[0,1] $ (in other words, the pencil is index one or has a simple
structure), if
$$
{\rm rank}~  A(t)=\deg(\det(\lambda A(t)+B(t)))=m={\rm const}
\quad \forall t \in [0,1],
$$ where $\lambda$ is scalar, and $\deg(.)$ denotes the degree of the polynomial.}


The following theorem from [14], describes the conditions under
which the IAE \eqref{eq_1} possesses a unique continuous solution.

{\bf Theorem 1} [14]{\bf .} {\it Let the problem \eqref{eq_1},
\eqref{eq_2} fulfill the following conditions$:$

1) $ A(t) \in C^{1}_{[0,1]}, \ ~ f(t) \in C^{1}_{[0,1]}, \ ~
K(t,s) \in C^{1}_{\Delta}, \ ~  \Delta = \{0\leq s~\leq~t~\leq~1
\};$

2)  the matrix pencil $\lambda A(t)+K(t,t)$ satisfies the
rank-degree criterion on the whole segment $\ [0,1];$

3) {\rm rank}~$ A(0)=$ {\rm rank}~$ (A(0)\mid f(0))$.

Then, the problem \eqref{eq_1}, \eqref{eq_2}  has a unique
continuous solution.}



Note that if $n=1$, i. e. if we deal with the first kind Volterra
equation, the second condition of Theorem 1 means that $
K(t,t)\neq 0, \ \forall t \in [0,1],$ whereas the third condition
has the form $f(0)=0.$ Those are the classic solvability
conditions for the first kind Volterra equation (see, e.~g.,
[3,~5]).

Systems that satisfy Theorem 1 can be considered as index-1 IAEs
in the sense of [14], which means that there exists a linear first
order differential operator that transforms the original system to
a regular system of Volterra equations of the second kind [25].

{\bf Definition 2} [14]{\bf .} {\it Let there exist a differential
operator $ \Omega_{l}=\sum \limits ^l_{j=0}L_j(t)\left
({{d}/{dt}}\right )^j,~~  t\in T, $ where $L_j(t)$ are $n\times n$
continuous matrices, such that
$$
\Omega_{l}\left[ A(t)y(t)+\int \limits
^t_0K(t,s)y(s)\right]=\tilde A(t)y+\int \limits ^t_0\tilde
K(t,s)y(s)ds,~~
$$
$$
 \det\;\tilde A(t)\neq 0~ \  \forall t\in T.
$$
Then the operator $\Omega_{l}$ is said to be the left regularizing
operator and the smallest possible number $l$ is said to be the
index of the IAE \eqref{eq_1}. }



The concept of index for IAEs originates from the theory of
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which is a crucial issue
in theoretical and numerical analysis of these equations (where
index is considered a key to theoretical and numerical analysis).
There are several definitions of index for DAEs, most of which are
covered in [26]. However, the situation with IAEs is not so clear
[12], so in this paper we employ Definition 1 as most suitable for
our purposes.


{\bf 3. Numerical algorithms.} This section presents some stable
numerical algorithms based on multistep methods for numerical
solution of IAEs. In contrast to the studies previously done in
[20], we now attempt to design an implicit scheme, which is
expected to have better convergence and better stability
properties.

On the segment $[0,1]$, set the uniform mesh  $t_{i}=ih,~~ i=0,1,
\ldots, N,~~ h=1/N$ and let $q(t)$ be a function from
$C^{p+1}_{[0,1]}.$ Then we will find
$\int\limits_{0}^{t_{i+1}}q(s)ds,$ using the $k$-step formula

\begin{equation}\label{polykstep}
\int\limits_{0}^{t_{i+1}}q(s)ds=\int\limits_{0}^{t_{k}}q(s)ds +
\sum_{j=k}^{i}\int\limits_{t_{j}}^{t_{j+1}}q(s)ds \simeq
h\sum_{l=0}^{k}{a_{l} q(t_{l}) }
+\sum_{j=k}^{i}{h\sum_{l=0}^{k}{b_{l} q(t_{j+1-l}) }
}=h\sum_{l=0}^{i+1}{\omega_{i+1,l}q_{l}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
(i=k, k+1, \ldots, N-1),
\end{equation*}
where the weights $\omega_{i+1,l}$ are the linear combinations of
$a_{l}$ and $b_{l}$, which are found from the order conditions: it
is well-known (see, e.~g., [3,~4]) that  if the following
equalities are satisfied:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_8}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{a_{l}}=k,\\
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{l \cdot a_{l}}=\frac{k^{2}}{2},\\
\cdots \\
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{l^{m-1}\cdot a_{l}}=\frac{k^{m}}{m},\\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_9}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{b_{l}}=1,\\
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{(1-l)b_{l}}=\frac{1}{2},\\
\cdots \\
\sum_{l=0}^{k}{(1-l)^{m-1}b_{l}}=\frac{1}{m},\\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
then the quadrature formula \eqref{polykstep} has order $m.$

If we denote $A_{i+1}=A(t_{i+1}), K_{i+1,l}=K(t_{i+1},t_{l}),
f_{i+1}=f(t_{i+1}),  x_{i+1}\simeq x(t_{i+1})$,  then, taking into
account the formula for representation of the integral term
(\ref{polykstep}), the multistep ($k$-step) methods for solving
IAEs \eqref{eq_1} have the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq_10}
A_{i+1}x_{i+1}+h\sum_{l=0}^{i+1}{\omega_{i+1,l}K_{i+1,l}x_{l}}=f_{i+1},\
~ i=k-1, k, ..., N-1.
\end{equation}
It is assumed that the values $x_{0}, x_{1}, ..., x_{k-1}$ have
been found with the prescribed accuracy. If $m=k+1$  in
\eqref{eq_8} and \eqref{eq_9}, we obtain the well-known implicit
Adams type methods, which are unstable. Therefore, set $m<k+1$. In
this case, the coefficients $b_{l}$, $a_{l}, \ l=0,1, \ldots, k$,
are not uniquely defined and satisfy the linear system of
algebraic equations of dimension  $m\times (k+1)$. For stability
reasons, we also have to assume  that the roots, generally complex
ones, of the polynomial
\begin{equation}\label{eq_11}
\sum_{l=0}^{k}b_{l}\nu^{k-l}
\end{equation}
belong to the unit disk and that the boundary of the disk does not
have multiple roots.

Convergence of method \eqref{eq_10} is provided by the following
theorem.

{\bf Theorem 2.} {\it    Let the problem \eqref{eq_1},
\eqref{eq_2} fulfill the conditions$:$

1)  $ x(t), \; A(t),\; f(t)  \in C^{k}_{[0,1]}, \;
    K(t,s) \in C^{(k+1)}_{\Delta},~~ \Delta=\{0\leq s\leq t \leq 1 \};$

2)  the matrix pencil $\lambda A(t)+K(t,t)$ satisfies the
rank-degree criterion on the whole segment $\ [0,1];$

3)  ${\rm rank}~ A(0)={\rm rank}~ (A(0)\mid f(0));$

4)  the initial values are such that $ ||x_{j}-x(t_{j})||\leq
Rh^{k},\ ~  R < \infty , \; j=0,1, \ldots ,k-1;$

5)  the roots of the characteristic polynomial \eqref{eq_11}
belong to a unit disk and the boundary of the disk does not
contain multiple roots.

Then, the method \eqref{eq_10} converges to the exact solution
with order $k$, i.~e. the following estimate holds$:~$
    $
    ||x_{i}-x(t_{i})||=O(h^{k}), \ ~  i=k,k+1, \ldots ,N-1.
    $ }



Since the proof of Theorem 2 happened to be pretty much similar to
that of Theo\-rem~3.1 from [20], we do not present it here.


{\bf 4. Second and third order methods: stability analysis.} Here
we address the properties of $k$-step methods of order $k.$ It is
assumed that either we are given the exact starting values $x_{0},
x_{1}, ..., x_{k-1}$ or they have been found with the accuracy
$O(h^{k+1}).$

Now we will show how to design stable two-step second order
methods. In this case, the integral approximation
\eqref{polykstep} have the form
\begin{equation*}\label{eq_42}
\int\limits_{0}^{t_{i+1}}q(\tau)d\tau =
\int\limits_{0}^{t_{2}}q(\tau)d\tau +
\sum_{j=2}^{i}{\int\limits_{t_{j}}^{t_{j+1}}q(\tau)d\tau
}\simeq
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\simeq h\sum_{l=0}^{2}{a_{l} q(t_{l}) }
+\sum_{j=2}^{i}{h\sum_{l=0}^{2}{b_{l} g(t_{j+1-l}) }
}=h\sum_{l=0}^{i+1}{\omega_{i+1,l}g_{l}},
\end{equation*}
whereas the order conditions  \eqref{eq_8},  \eqref{eq_9} are
reduced to
\begin{equation*} \label{eq_41}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}a_{0}+a_{1} +a_{2} =2,\\
a_{1} +2a_{2} =2, \\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*} \label{budnikova_eq_09}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}b_{2}+b_{1} +b_{0} =1,\\
-b_{2} +b_{0} =\frac{1}{2}. \\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}


\noindent Set $a_{2} = b_{0}=M$, $M\in {\mathbb R},$ and find
$a_0, a_1, b_1, b_2$. Then we derive the following values for the
weights $\omega_{i+1,l}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_43}
\omega_{i+1,l}=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}M&2-2M& M\\M&\frac{3}{2}-M&\frac{3}{2}-M&M\\M&\frac{3}{2}-M&1&\frac{3}{2}-M&M\\
M&\frac{3}{2}-M&1&1&\frac{3}{2}-M&M\\ \dots & \dots & \dots &
\dots & \dots & \dots &\dots
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Now we have to find the values of $M$ for which the
two-step method is stable. The characteristic polynomial
\eqref{eq_11} takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{charpol1}
M\nu^2+\left(\frac{3}{2}-2M\right)\nu+\left(M-\frac{1}{2}\right)=0,
\end{equation}
and the two-step method \eqref{eq_10} is stable, if the roots of
\eqref{charpol1} belong to the unit disk and the boundary of the
disk does not have multiple roots. To verify this, we employ a
standard technique: we will study the image of the exterior of the
unit disk under the mapping  $\nu=\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha-1}.$ We
obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq_49}
(M+1)\alpha^2+\alpha+(4M-2)=0.
\end{equation}

\noindent Apply the Routh---Hurwitz criterion (see, e.~g., [27])
to \eqref{eq_49}. Then we see that the real part of $\alpha$ is
negative, if
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}M+1 \geq 0,\\
4M-2 \geq 0. \\
\end{array}\right.
$$\pagebreak

\noindent These inequalities entail that the two-step second order
methods \eqref{eq_9}  with the weights~\eqref{eq_43} are stable,
if $M~\in~[\frac{1}{2}, +\infty).$

The weights of the two-step third order method can be found from
the conditions
\begin{equation*} \label{eq_44}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
a_{0}+a_{1} +a_{2} + a_{3} =3,\\
a_{1} +2a_{2}+3 a_{3}=\frac{9}{2}, \\
a_{1} +4a_{2}+9 a_{3}=9, \\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*} \label{eq_45}
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}b_{3}+b_{2} +b_{1}+ b_{0} =1,\\
-2b_{3}-b_{2} +b_{0} =\frac{1}{2}. \\
4b_{3}+b_{2} +b_{0} =\frac{1}{3}. \\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}

\noindent Set $a_{3}=b_{0}=M $. Then the weight matrix  has the
form
\begin{equation}\label{eq_46}
\omega_{i+1,l}=\! \left( \!\begin{array}{cccccccc}\frac{3}{4}-M  \!\!&3M  \! \!&\frac{9}{4}-3M& M\\[0.1cm] \frac{3}{4}-M \! \!&\frac{5}{12}+2M \! \!&\frac{11}{12}&\frac{23}{12}-2M \!\!& M\\[0.1cm] \frac{3}{4}-M \! \!&\frac{5}{12}+2M \! \!&\frac{16}{12}-M&\frac{7}{12}+M&\frac{23}{12}-2M& M\\[0.1cm]
\frac{3}{4}-M \! \!&\frac{5}{12}+2M \!
\!&\frac{16}{12}-M&1&\frac{7}{12}+M&\frac{23}{12}-2M \!\!&
M\\[0.1cm] \frac{3}{4}-M \! \!&\frac{5}
{12}+2M \! \!&\frac{16}{12}-M&1&1&\frac{7}{12}+M&\frac{23}{12}-2M& \!\! M\\[0.1cm]
\dots \! \! & \dots \! \! & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots &\dots
&\dots
\end{array}\!\! \right)\!\!.
\end{equation}

\noindent Our aim is to find such values of $M$ that provide
stability of the method. The characteristic polynomial has the
form
\begin{equation*}\label{charpol2}
M\nu^3+\left(\frac{23}{12}-3M\right)\nu^2+\left(3M-\frac{16}{12}\right)\nu+\left(\frac{5}{12}-M\right)=0.
\end{equation*}

\noindent By using the substitution
$\nu=\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha-1}$, we obtained the  the polynomial
\begin{equation*}
\alpha^3+2\alpha^2+\frac{8}{12}\alpha+\left(8M-\frac{11}{3}\right)=0.
\end{equation*}

Similarly, the Rauth---Hurwitz criterion yields that the
three-step method \eqref{eq_10} with the weight matrix
\eqref{eq_46} is stable for the class of problems under
consideration,  if $M~\in~[\frac{11}{24}, \frac{15}{24}].$

{\bf Remark 1.} To implement the numerical algorithm, we need to
know values of $x(t)$ in the first $k$ points. We  can use two
techniques, which are widely employed in the numerical treatment
of ODEs:

1) take a much smaller integration step and apply some simple
algorithm based on the right point rule [14];

2) solve the problem numerically on the segment $[0,kh]$ by
$k$-step collocation methods~[1, 3]. Such methods do not require
to know initial values, and, since we apply them only once, there
is no need to justify their stability.


In the section 5  we will test the  algorithms proposed to
illustrate our theoretical speculations.

{\bf 5. Some experimental results}. Now we present some numerical
examples to clarify the accuracy and stability issues of the
algorithms proposed.  The multistep methods  considered in the
previous sections were applied to the IAE \eqref{eq_1} on the
interval $[0,1]$ for several values of $M$. The algorithms were
coded in MATLAB$^\circledR$.\pagebreak

{\bf Example 1} [20]{\bf .}
%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \! \! \begin{array}{cc} 1&t\\t&t^{2}\\\end{array} \! \!
\right)\left( \! \!
\begin{array}{c}x_{1}(t)\\x_{2}(t)\\\end{array} \! \! \right)+
\int\limits_{0}^{t}\left( \! \!
\begin{array}{cc}e^{t-s}&0\\e^{-2s}&
e^{t+s}\\\end{array} \! \! \right)\left( \! \!
\begin{array}{c}x_{1}(s)\\x_{2}(s)\\\end{array} \! \! \right)ds=\left( \! \! \begin{array}{c}
e^t(1+t)+te^{-t}\\
e^{-t}(e^{2t}+e^t+t^2-1)+te^t\\\end{array} \! \! \right),
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}\label{iae1}
0 \leq t \leq 1.
\end{equation*}
\noindent The exact solution is  $x(t)=(e^t, e^{-t})^{\top}.$


The maximum of the errors between the obtained approximate
solutions of the two- and three-step methods with the
corresponding weight matrices and the exact solutions for various
values of $M$ and $h$ have been tabulated in Tables~1--4 for both
examples. Numerical experiments fully confirmed the theoretical
estimations. As predicted, within the stability interval for $M$
the error  decreases; however, if $M$  is taken outside of the
stability interval, the error behavior is extremely unstable.


Figures 1--6 demonstrate the error behaviors of the methods for
different values of $M$ (taken within and outside of the stability
interval) and $h$.

    with the exact solution: $x(t)=(\cos t, \sin 3t)^\top$.




The results of our numerical experiments show the effects of
varying $M$ and $h$ on the accuracy of the method. Note that for
the two-step method the increase of $M$ negatively affects the
accuracy and the convergence order of the method. For large values
of $M$, the expected convergence can be observed only if we choose
a small enough $h$.  This is due to the fact that if $M$ is big
enough,  the characteristic polynomial \eqref{charpol1} tends to
have the form $\nu^2-2\nu+1$, e.~g. the absolute values of its
roots become very close to 1.

However, the situation is different for the three-step method. The
stability interval for $M$ is very narrow:
$M~\in~[\frac{11}{24},\frac{15}{24}]$ vs.
$M\in[\frac{1}{2},+\infty)$ for the two-step method. Choosing the
optimal value of  the weight parameter $M$ might be interesting
from theoretical and numerical points of view. For both methods we
can observe that the best convergence  is obtained at the
beginning of the stability intervals: $M=1/2$ provides best
results for the two-step method, whereas $M=11/24$ appears to be
the optimal value of the three-step algorithm.   We will pay a
special attention to this issue in future work.


{\bf 6. Conclusion.} We considered application of implicit
multistep methods to solving index-1 IAEs and singled out classes
of two- and three-step methods of orders two and three,
correspondingly. Numerical experiments  confirmed theoretical
results and showed the efficiency and applicability of the methods
proposed. We revealed that the stability of the algorithms can be
handled by an appropriate choice of the weight parameter and
experimentally confirmed it. Compared to the previous research
conducted in this area [20], the new methods are able to reach a
higher order of convergence, and therefore, future work suggests a
more detailed analysis of the error behavior for complex ill-posed
problems, as well as the construction of stable $k$-step methods
of order $k$ ($k>3$).
