\textbf{Introduction.} It is very important to minimize evacuation
time and human sacrifices in the evacuation processes. Different
approaches are used to investigate building evacuation. Existing
mathematical models for building evacuation can be categorized as
in [1] including mesocopic models in addition:

$\bullet$\,\,Cellular Automata (CA)~--- evacuation area is
represented as a grid and each occupant can take only one cell per
unit time. The state of each cell depends on states of neighbour
cells and the state of the considered cell. Examples of CA models
were considered in [2, 3], the main of them are PedGo, EGRESS,
SGEM and EVAC. CA models use one set of movement rules for each
occupant, exact set of rules depends on specific CA model.

$\bullet$\,\,Agent-based models~--- these models illustrates
actions and interactions of auto\-no\-mous agents. They consider
individual parameters for each agent. Count of pa\-ra\-me\-ters
depends on specific model (e. g. mobility group, walking speed,
weight, projected area). Agent-based models are also known as
\textit{microscopic} models [4]. These models are implemented in
such software applications as Simulex, Steps, BuildingExodus and
Pathfinder, they also mentioned in~[4].

$\bullet$\,\,Flow-based models~--- these models do not consider
personal behavior. All particles in such models have the same
parameters. Only common characteristics are taking into account.
These models are also known as \textit{macroscopic} models [4].
Examples of macroscopic models were considered in [2], the main of
them are Myriad, EgressComplexityModel\linebreak\newpage\noindent
and VEgAS. Macroscopic models are similar to a black box due to
internal procedures of their particles are unknown.

$\bullet$\,\,{\it Mesoscopic models}~--- these type of models is a
hybrid of microscopic and macroscopic models. Agents are split up
into separate groups with common characteristics within the group
(common exit, the same walking speed, etc.). Examples of
mesoscopic models applied in evacuation tasks were considered in
[5,~6].

In this research work we investigated macroscopic approach. The
evacuation space in suggested model was presented as Dynamic Graph
Network (DGN), where we illustrated evacuation processes. Quickest
Flow Problem (QFP) is one of the major problem in DGN. Different
researchers work out this problem [7--9]. QFP generalisation [7]:
send given amount of flow from sources to sinks in the shortest
possible time.  We used DGN as a model of a corridor-type building
to investigate QFP. Developed algorithm and software were used to
model the evacuation processes.

\textbf{Proposed model.} The model of a building is a connected
graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, $E$ is a set of
edges, $E \subset \{\{u,v\}|u,v \in V\}$. Each vertex $v\in V$ has
non-negative weight $w_{v0}$ that means a number of particles in
the vertex. For the corridor-type buildings the value $w_{v0}$ can
be calculated with location algorithm considered at [10].
Evacuation process will be described as a flow on the graph. The
flow determines a number of particles moving through edges from
vertices $v\in V$ to vertices $u\in U,\; U\subseteq V$ (exits from
a building).

Edges with positive flow value generate forest of rooted trees
with roots from the set $U$. All paths in this forest are directed
to the roots. Considered flow cannot be split. Such type of flows
is known as \textit{confluent} [9]. In case of splitting flows
existing approaches can be used for QFP [7, 8,~11].

Lets call subgraph $H=(V,A)$ of the graph $G$ as \textit{covering
rooted forest} ($A$ is a set of edges), if it meets the terms:
%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]

$\bullet$~subgraph $H$ is directed~--- movement direction is
defined by exits (roots);%

$\bullet$~out-degree $d^-(u)=0,
\text{\,} ~ \forall \text{\,} u \in U$ in subgraph $H$;%

$\bullet$~out-degree $d^-(v)=1, \text{\,} ~ \forall \text{\,} v
\in
V \setminus U$ in subgraph $H$;%

$\bullet$~$\forall\, v \in V \setminus U$ has a path to a root $u
\in U$.
%\end{itemize}

Vertices $u \in U$ are roots of trees from the forest $H$. All
vertices $v \in V$ are contained in the forest $H$ trees; $\Omega$
is a set of subgraphs $H$; $\Gamma^+(v)$ is a set of vertices that
are connected to vertex $v$ in the subgraph $H$:
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma^+(v) = \{u\in V\;|\;(u,v)\in A\}, \ ~~ v\in V;
\end{equation*}
$a(v)$ is a vertex to which an edge is directed from vertex $v \in
V\setminus U$ in the subgraph $H$; $Q_{uv}$ is flow capacity for
any edge $(u,v)\in E; \; Q_{uv} = Q_{vu}, ~ %\text{\,}
\forall
\text{\,} u, v \in E$. $W_{v}$ is constraint for a~number of
particles in a vertex $v$ (vertex capacity); $w_{vt}$ is a number
of particles in a~vertex $v$ at unit time $t$; $T$ is constraint
for evacuation time; $Z_{\geqslant 0}$ is a set of non-negative
integers.

\textbf{Definition.} \textit{Flow is a function $x: A \times t \to
Z_{\geqslant 0}$ that determines non-negative integer for each
edge per unit time. This function has the following properties}:
%\begin{itemize}

\textit{$\it 1)$  flow capacity constraint}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop1}
0 \leqslant x_{uv} \leqslant Q_{uv} \;\;~ \forall\; u, v \in A;
\end{equation}

\textit{$\it 2)$ constraint for a number of particles in
vertices}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop2}
w_{vt} \leqslant  W_{v} \;\;~ \forall\; v \in V,\,~ t=1,...,T;
\end{equation}

\textit{$\it 3)$ balance equations}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop3_1}
w_{vt} = w_{v, t-1} - x_{va(v)t}+\sum_{u\in\Gamma(v)}x_{uv,t-1}
\;\;~ \forall\;  v \in V\setminus U, \;~ t=1,...,T,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop3_2}
w_{vt} = w_{v, t-1}+\sum_{u\in\Gamma(v)}x_{uv,t-1} \;\;~ \forall\;
v \in U, \;~ t=1,...,T;
\end{equation}

\textit{$\it 4)$ particles count}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prop4}
\sum_{u\in U}w_{uT} = \sum_{v \in V\setminus U}w_{v0}.
\end{equation}
%\end{itemize}

%}
%\end{Definition}
In formulas (\ref{eq:prop1})--(\ref{eq:prop4}) $x_{uv}$ is the
value of function $x$ for pair $(u,v)$. The main task is to find
such rooted forest $H$ that allows to get quickest flow for each
vertex $v \in V \setminus U$ with positive value of $w_{v0}$ (this
is a criterion of optimality for considered model). Objective
function can be described as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:objective_function}
 x \to \text{min}\displaystyle\sum_{v,a(v)}t_{v,a(v)}x_{v,a(v)} ~ ~~ \forall\; v \in V,
\end{equation}
where $t_{v,a(v)}$ is transition time for edge $(v,a(v))$.

Quickest flow problem could be considered similar to a problem of
maximal dynamic flow that was described in [12], but sources in
the evacuation process have limited value of particles $w_{v0}$.
As a result flow value from a non-empty vertex can be less than
capacity of its exiting edge. In this case QFP can be formulated
in [8] as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:objective_function_qfp}
T \geq \frac{|\hat{x}|+
\displaystyle\sum_{v,a(v)}t_{v,a(v)}x_{v,a(v)}}{|x|} ~ ~~
\forall\; v \in V,
\end{equation}
where $|\hat{x}|$ is a flow value that should be transferred from
a source to a sink; $|x|$~is the total amount of flow that leaves
the source. Evacuation process requires to move all occupants from
sources to sinks that is described by equation (\ref{eq:prop4}).
As a result $|\hat{x}| = |x|$ in equation
(\ref{eq:objective_function_qfp}) and we use the objective
function (\ref{eq:objective_function}).




We consider a building as non-overlapping sets of zones. Each zone
is a room or a part of corridor, where occupants can concentrate.
Vertices in the model are the equivalent of zones. A couple of
vertices is adjacent if related zones are nearest-neighbours.
Occupants can move only between such zones and as a result flow is
progressing between adjacent vertices only. Similar approach is
used in [8]. Each edge can be split to small zones (verti\-ces),
where a flow is progressing through them in sequence. Such
approach allows to move particles between a couple of vertices per
unit time fulfilling by that the third property of the model.

\textbf{Proposed algorithm.} For testing purposes we developed a
heuristic algorithm that includes the following stages:

1. Get undirected graph $G$ with all required properties (vertices
with particles, number of particles, capacity of vertices, length
and width for each edge). At this stage, the algorithm also gets
available flow parameters including mobility groups ($M_i$, where
$i$ is a group number) and their proportion, flow density
constraint ($D_{\text{max}},\; m^2/m^2$), evacuation time
constraint ($T$), max count of paths from one non-empty vertex
($\text{max}\; d^-(v)$).

%\vspace{-0.5em}
2. Set weights for all edges. Edge weight is determined as
transferring time of one particle for selected values of $M_i$ and
flow density value $D_i=0.1,\; m^2/m^2$. Flow velocity is
determined as function $V(M_i,D_i)$, its values are described in %
%\href{http://docs.cntd.ru/document/gost-12-1-004-91-ssbt}{%
GOST 12.1.004--91 %}
(name is in English) and %
%\href{http://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200089976}{%
SP 59.13330.2012 %}
(name is in English). Transferring time for one
particle is calculated as
%
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:simple_edge_weight}
 t^1_{uv} = l_{uv}/V(M_i,D_i),
\end{equation*}
where $l_{uv}$ is the edge $\{u,v\}$ length.

%\vspace{-0.5em}
3. Search for escape routes for non-empty vertices
by using Dijkstra's algorithm. A separate escape route is
considered as a simple chain. Weight of each chain is calculated
as a sum of their edges weights that are recalculated as
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:edge_weight}
     c_{\{v,a(v)\}} = \frac{d^+(v)\cdot d^+(a(v))\cdot d^-(v)\cdot d^-(a(v))}{\text{min}(W_{\{v,a(v)\}},W_v,W_{a(v)})},
\end{equation*}
here $W_{\{v,a(v)\}}$ is the edge $\{v,a(v)\}$ capacity. Chain
priority depends on its weight~--- the lower weight value provides
the higher priority.

%\vspace{-0.5em}
4. Choose the covering rooted forest $H$ and move all flows to its
roots. At this stage, simple chains will be selected for each
non-empty vertex. Figures~1 and 2 illustrate a process  of such
selection. Figure~1 contains an example of simple chains selected
for each non-empty vertices (steps 1--7):\\

A set of selected chains can be illustrated as a directed graph
that includes all possible sub-graphs $H$ (edges directions can
differ in different subgraphs, that is $\Omega$). In the next step
the algorithm validates out-degrees for all vertices going through
selected chains from the shortest one to the longest one. If any
vertex has $d^-(v)>1$ the algorithm excludes the appropriate chain
from the graph (step 8, figure 2). Covering rooted forest $H$ will
be gotten before flow movement. After that all flows will be sent
in accordance with the model properties.

Figures 3 and 4 describe implemented flow movement into common
exit and trough an occupied area (vertex) appropriately. Exits
don't have constraints for their capacity as a result $W_u \to
\infty,\; \forall\; u \in U$. Nevertheless exits bandwidth is
limited by their door way sizes. Figure 3 describes movement for
two flows into a common exit based on assumption that both flows
are using the same door (exit has only one door). In the algorithm
we are considering flows as groups of particles that can be placed
on a segment $b$ equal to edge width. Only one group can be moved
into $u \in U$ per unit time, this process can be described as

\textbf{$t_i$}: both flows are ready to be moved into vertex $u$;

\textbf{$t_{i+1}$}: group $x^b_{e_1}$ (5 particles) moves into
vertex $u$;

\textbf{$t_{i+2}$}: group $x^b_{e_2}$ (3 particles) moves into
vertex $u$;

\textbf{$t_{i+3}$}: group $x^b_{e_1}$ (5 particles) moves into
vertex $u$;

\textbf{$t_{i+4}$}: etc.

\vskip 2mm {\small{\it Figure 3.} Flows movement into a common

\end{figure}


For the occupied area detailed example is on the figure 4. Groups
sizes can differ for both inbound and outbound edges. This example
illustrates a case, where outbound edge width is less than the
inbound one:

\textbf{$t_i$}: a number of particles is equal to the vertex
capacity ($w_{vt_i}=W_v$), the flow is not moving at this instant
of time;

\textbf{$t_{i+1}$}: group $x^b_{e_2}$ (3 particles) left the
vertex and the same number of particles ($x^b_{e_1} > x^b_{e_2}$,
$x^b_{e_1}$ should be decreased) arrived there at the same instant
of time;

\textbf{$t_{i+2}$}: group $x^b_{e_2}$ (3 particles) left the
vertex and the same number of particles arrived there at the same
instant of time;

\textbf{$t_{i+3}$}: etc.

Described model cannot be considered as a microscopic model or a
mesoscopic one.  In the algorithm we implemented different
mobility groups described in
\href{http://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200089976}{SP 59.13330.2012}
to get a tradeoff between microscopic and macroscopic approaches.
As a result the algorithm allows to send multicommodity flows.
Mobility group cannot be assigned to a separate particle or a
group of particles. The algorithm recalculates flows velocity by
using the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mixed_flow_vilocity}
\widetilde{V}_{uv} =
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m}\widetilde{V}_{uv}^{j}p^j}{\sum_{j=1}^{m}p^j},
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{V}_{uv}^j$ is flow velocity (m/min) for mobility
group $j$ on the edge $\{u,v\} \in E$; $p^j$ is number of
particles from mobility group $j$; $m$~is number of mobility
groups. $\widetilde{V}_{uv}^j$ depends on edge type and flow
density for mobility group $j$ on the edge $\{u,v\} \in E$ denoted
as $\widetilde{D}_{uv}^j$ (can be calculated similar to equation
(\ref{eq:mixed_flow_vilocity})).

\textbf{Experiments.} All experiments were done in the
Petrozavodsk State University. Actual and calculated evacuation
time are presented in the Table. There were 8 emergency training
exercises in the main building that were performed in different
years. We didn't have information about occupants positions in the
real experiments. In the modelled experiments occupants were
placed in classrooms on a pro rata basis (in accordance with count
of chairs). Based on information provided we used the following
proportion in all modelled experiments: 95\,\% of occupants from
mobility group $M_1$ and 5\,\% of occupants from mobility
group~$M_2$.

Actual and calculated average values of evacuation time for the
results are 5.80 and 3.82 minutes accordingly. In all cases
calculated evacuation time is less than the actual one. The reason
of that can be explained by occupants knowledge about available
exits. If people don't know the structure of the building well
enough, they will use an exit that was used as an entrance. Such
scenario excludes other exits that can be easier to reach [1].
Also people can prefer blocked exits, in such cases they have to
spend time for searching another evacuation path. And one more
additional factor that increases the actual evacuation time is an
emergency training exercise. In case of a real emergency situation
occupants will leave the building faster, but it also depends on
count of blocked exits.

Figure 5 contains detailed results for the 8th experiment. We
modelled evacuation process from all floors (considered building
consist of 5 floors). Source of combustion was at the same place
on the 2d floor for both real and modelled experiments. Exits 3
and 4 were technically blocked, they are placed in a recital room
that was closed in all experiments.%

\end{figure}%

For the estimation purposes we have coined a term \textit{real
capacity of an exit} (RCE) that means count of occupants moving
through an exit per unit time in the evacuation process limited by
$T$ value. RCE value can be calculated as
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:RCE_value}
     {\rm RCE}^u = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}p^u_i}{\hat{T}^u}, \text{\;}~ u\in U,
\end{equation*}
where $u$ is an exit number, $p^u_i$ is a particle with index $i$
in the exit $u$, $\hat{T}^u$ is evacuation time (sec) for the exit
$u$. Figure 6 contains RCE curves for both real and modelled
experiments for all used exits.

Both curves have similar RCE values for all exits except the 2d
one. Actual RCE value for the 2d exit is substantially smaller
(0.26 vs. 0.49). Actual result for the 2d exit can be explained by
a small amount of occupants for a large value of $\hat{T}$ (195
vs. 148). Correlation coefficient for RCE curves is 0.905, this
result confirms adequacy of the algorithm and the model
properties.

\textbf{Conclusion.} The obtained results allow to conclude that
developed model, the algorithm and software can be used to emulate
evacuation processes in the corridor-type buildings. The model
describes dynamic flows movement trough a directed graph, the
algorithm used this model to move the flows, and developed
software implements the algorithm for modelling evacuation
process. Also, the software can be used in the design stage of
buildings to meet the fire safety regulations.

At present, our model does not take into account flows separation
in vertices and structural dynamic changes that could occur after
starting evacuation process, for instance, new sources of
combustion that block some evacuation paths.

We believe that our model and the algorithm can be a good start
point for the further researches of evacuation processes in
different types of buildings. Model limitations mentioned above
also will be covered in the further researchers.
