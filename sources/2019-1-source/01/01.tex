{\leftskip=7mm\noindent The stray poloidal magnetic field produced
in ITER outside the tokamak is significantly higher than in any
present machines. This magnetic field magnetizes the steel rebar
reinforcing the building concrete structures enclosing the
tokamak. As a result, reinforced structures of the ITER building
may produce a substantial magnetic field with the axisymmetric
component (toroidal mode number $n = 0$) affecting the plasma
initiation and non-axisymmetric components (``error fields'' with
$n = 1; 2$) deteriorating plasma perfor\-mance. This paper
presents an upgraded Magnetic Model of the ITER Tokamak Complex,
\mbox{MMTC-2.2}, for assessment of the stray field associated with
the reinforced structures. This magnetic model MMTC-2.2 takes into
account the CATIA models of the Tokamak Complex Buildings and
volumetric fractions of steel for the rebar in the building
structures as they were
in the design in 2016.\\[1mm]

{\bf Introduction.} The ITER Tokamak Complex (Fig.~1 [1]) consists
of the Tokamak and Tritium nuclear buildings and the Diagnostic
building [2] located in a common pit (Fig.~2).

The tokamak itself is located in the bioshield pit of the main
nuclear building {\em 11}. A circular lid closes the bioshield
from the top at the upper levels of the building (Fig.~2).

Most of the building structures of the ITER Tokamak Complex
contain magnetic materials such as steel rebar in concrete. To
assess the magnetic fields produced by concrete reinforced with
steel rebar and, therefore, magnetized by the stray field of the
tokamak, a simplified global magnetic model of the Tokamak Complex
(MMTC-1) was proposed in [3]. The MMTC-1 was based on the
preliminary design of the ITER Tokamak Complex. The model
contained a restricted set of the global tokamak building
structures described in [3]. The MMTC-1 was used for the
assessment of the error fields associated with a global asymmetry
of the tokamak complex [3] and stray fields outside [4] and inside
[5] the Vacuum Vessel.

This paper describes an upgraded magnetic model of the Tokamak
Complex, \mbox{MMTC-2.2}, which takes into account the data
obtained with the use of the CATIA CAD/CAM multi-platform software
suite [6] and the volumetric steel fractions in the building
structures as they were in the design of Tokamak Complex buildings
in 2016. The model MMTC-2.2 includes all the tokamak building
structures and the Excavation seismic pit and, therefore, can be
considered as a complete magnetic model of the Tokamak Complex.
For this reason, the model MMTC-1 appears to be obsolete, and
preliminary evaluations in [3--5] should be renewed. Corresponding
results will be presented elsewhere.

The Tokamak General Coordinate System (TGCS) was used in this
study.\newpage

{\bf Calculation of magnetic field.} The anticipated field is
simulated with the code KLONDIKE [7, 8] utilizing the integral
formulation of the magnetic field problem [9--11] in terms of the
magnetization vector. The magnetization distribution is calculated
as a self-consistent problem implemented with the code as
described below.

The magnetic field strength at an observation point $\mathbf{a}$
produced by a magnetic material with magnetization $\mathbf{M}$
and volume $dV$ located at the point $\mathbf{r}$ is determined as
[12, 13]
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
d\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{a})=-\frac{dV}{4\pi}\nabla_\mathbf{a}
\frac{\left(\mathbf{M}\cdot(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r})\right)}{\left|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r}\right|^3},
\end{equation}
where in the Cartesian coordinates \( \nabla_\mathbf{a} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{e}_1 +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y_\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{e}_2 +
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{e}_3 \), here
$\mathbf{e}_1$, $\mathbf{e}_2$, $\mathbf{e}_3$ are the orts of the
coordinate system.

Thus, spatial derivation in equation (1) is made at a constant
radius-vector $\mathbf{r}$ for the point, where the magnetized
volume $dV$ is located.

The field generated by magnetized volume $V$ is determined as
\begin{equation*}\label{eq2}
\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{a})=-\frac{1}{4\pi} \int\limits_V
\nabla_\mathbf{a}
\frac{\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r})}{\left|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r}\right|^3}
dV.
\end{equation*}

Assuming a uniform magnetization, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{a})=\frac{1}{4\pi} \int\limits_S
\frac{\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r})}{\left|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r}\right|^3}
d\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_{i=1}^3 M_i \int\limits_S
\frac{a_i - r_i}{\left|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r}\right|^3}
d\mathbf{S},
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the surface bounding the volume $V$; $M_i$, $a_i$,
$r_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) are respective vector components.
Mathematically, formula (2) is equivalent to the matrix equation
\begin{equation*}\label{eq4}
\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{a})= \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{M},
\end{equation*}
here $\mathbf{M}$ is the constant magnetization vector in the
volume $V$; the matrix $\mathbf A$ is expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq5}
A_{ij} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int\limits_S \frac{a_i -
r_i}{\left|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{r}\right|^3} (\mathbf{e}_j\cdot
d\mathbf{S}).
\end{equation}
If volume $V$ is bounded with flat faces, the matrix coefficients
$A_{ij}$ can be found analytically.

In a magnetic medium
\begin{equation}\label{eq6}
\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{H}).
\end{equation}
In (4) $\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{H})$ is the material equation
presenting, in general case, the magnetization $\mathbf{M}$ as a
known nonlinear function of the total magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$.
For non-retentive isotropic materials
$\mathbf{M}=(\mu(H)-1)\mathbf{H}$, here $\mu(H)$ is the magnetic
permeability, $H=|\mathbf{H}|$.

To calculate the field we apply a volume integral equation (VIE)
method. The volume $V$ with a magnetic material is assumed to be
comprised of $N$ uniformly magnetized domains $V_k$ such that
$V=\bigcup_{k=1}^N V_k$  and $V_i \bigcap V_j = 0$ for all $i\neq
j$.

Assume that equation~6 is given for every domain $V_k$. Then, for
any $V_k$ we can write a system of nonlinear algebraic equations
in terms of magnetization $\mathbf{M}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq7} \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{H}_{tot} = \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{H}_{ext}, \\
\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{H}_{tot}),
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf A$ is the ($3\times 3$) influence matrix of the
components of $\mathbf{M}$ associated with the domain $V_k$ in
formula~(3); $\mathbf{H}_{ext}$ is the external field with respect
to $V_k$; $\mathbf{H}_{tot}$ is the total field in the centre of
$V_k$.

The system (5) is solved through a simple iteration procedure
[14,~15]:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq8}
\mathbf{M}^{(n+1)} = \mathbf{M}^{(n)} + \alpha\left(
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{(n)} + \mathbf{H}_{ext}) -
\mathbf{M}^{(n)} \right),
\end{equation*}
here $\mathbf{M}^{(n)}$ and $\mathbf{M}^{(n+1)}$ are,
respectively, magnetization obtained in successive iterations,
$\alpha$ is the iteration parameter. A higher convergence rate can
be achieved with the use of the BT process [16] of the iterative
acceleration thus making computations more time-effective.

To stop the iterative solution, the following criterion is
applied:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq9}
\left|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{(n)} + \mathbf{H}_{ext}) -
\mathbf{M}^{(n)} \right| \leq \delta\left|\mathbf{M}^{(n)}\right|
+ \varepsilon,
\end{equation*}
where $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$ are the relative and absolute
accuracy of the solution, respectively.

{\bf Magnetic model of tokamak building. Calculation results.} As
shown [17,~18], a required engineering accuracy of a few percent
for field evaluation with regard to the effect of steel rebar
reinforcement can be largely provided with an isotropic model
described below.

The tokamak building consists of five machine levels B2, B1, L1,
L2, L3, two upper levels L4, L5 and two roof levels R1, R2
(Fig.~3).

The accepted tokamak complex sectioning (Fig.~4) correspond to
regions with different steel fractions. The area related to the
tokamak building is marked white. The building center is sectioned
with concentric circles with the following outer radii:
$R_1=8.94$~m for the section S1, $R_2=12.08$~m for the section S2,
$R_3=18.4$~m for the section S3, $R_4=29.69$~m for the section S4.

A detailed description of each level is given in the Appendix~A.

In the finalized computational model MMTC-2.2 (Fig.~7) the tokamak
building structures are represented via a set of uni\-formly
magnetized volume elements (``bricks''). The magnetization
distribution is found self-consistently as described in the
previous section. Then the stray field from MMTC-2.2 at any point
is a sum of fields from all magnetized bricks.

A comparison and cross-checking computations on model validation
are presented in [17--19]. Being calculated on the base of
analytical expressions, the field as the ``Maxwell'' one simulated
with the code KLONDIKE is smooth by definition.

In similar models (MMTC-1 [3], MMTC-2.2) the lattice of steel bars
is replaced by an equivalent homogeneous isotropic materials with
magnetic properties described by the dependence of magnetic
induction $B=0.5k\cdot f(H)$ on the field strength $H$. Here
$f(H)$ is the magnetization curve of the reinforcement [20] and
$k$ is the volumetric filling factor of concrete with
reinforcement. Coefficient 0.5 is the effective filling factor for
the typical placement of bars in two mutually perpendicular
directions [17], in which 50\,\% of reinforcement bars can
effectively conduct the magnetic flux of the external field
oriented along the bars. This occurs when the field is parallel to
the plane of the bar lattice. In the perpendicular direction to
this plane there are no bars to conduct effectively the magnetic
flux. As the consequence, the magnetization in the perpendicular
direction must be weak, and the effect of the corresponding field
component manifests relatively weakly [17, 18].

Figure~8 presents a simulated field map produced by the magnetized
steel structures of the tokamak building only at the End-Of-Burn
(EOB) state of the representative 15~MA DT scenario, when the
stray field of the tokamak is maximal. The total stray field
around the machine is presented in Fig.~9.

{\bf Conclusions.} The detailed magnetic model MMTC-2.2 of the
ITER tokamak complex has been developed that reflects the design
of the tokamak building and volumetric fractions of the steel
reinforcement as they were in 2016. The model includes the
excavation support structures and all the building levels B2--R2
up to the roof and can be considered as a complete magnetic model
of the tokamak building. The model describes in detail the slabs,
bioshield, external and internal walls, internal port cell walls,
columns and steel doors at every level.

Developed in the frame of the integral approach, the model allows
us easily to take into account additional structures (for example,
the magnetic field reduction systems of injectors) and their
magnetic effect.

Using MMTC-2.2, the magnetic field produced by the ITER PF system,
plasma and magnetized steel structures of the tokamak complex has
been calculated for the EOB state of the representative 15 MA DT
scenario. The simulated field maps are presented in the central
cross-section of the tokamak building, that can be used for first
estimation of the magnetic field around the machine.

The MMTC-2.2 itself and the simulated fields of the tokamak
building are planned to be applied for a series of related
problems:

-- correction of scenario of PF system operation to provide the
plasma breakdown conditions;

-- assessment of error fields produced by magnetized steel
structures;

-- calculation of magnetic fields for assessment of functionality
of magnetic-sensitive equipment;

-- evaluation of magnetic forces acting on building structures,
etc.

These studies are under progress now.

{\bf Appendix A. Detailed description of the levels B2--R2}

{\bf A.1. Level B2 (the lowest level)}

{\em B2 level slab}. The B2 level slab (see Fig.~5, $a$, pos.~{\em
1}) is a concrete plate with the dimensions of 72.5~m in the
north-south direction and 80.8~m in the east–west direction. The
slab thickness is 1.5~m. The volumetric fractions of steel rebar
for the sections S1, S2, and S3 (see Fig.~4) are 6.87, 8.38 and
6.02\,\%, respectively. An average volumetric fraction of steel
rebar at the subsections S41--S46 (see Fig.~4) has been assessed
as 4.77\,\% for the common section S4. An average volumetric
fraction of steel rebar for the rest has been evaluated as
2.34\,\%.

{\em B2 level bioshield}. The concrete bioshield is an 18-hedron
structure (see Fig.~6) located within the section S3 (see Fig.~4)
in the central part of the tokamak building. The bioshield
thickness at the level B2 is 3.25~m. The volumetric fraction of
steel rebar at this level is 4.5\,\%. The bioshield has been
modeled as three solid trapezoids in every 1/18 part of the
18-hedron structure in order to simulate in details the curvature
of the bioshield in the toroidal direction.

{\em B2 level port cell walls}. The port cell walls at the level
B2 form a concrete cylinder with a thickness of 0.8~m. There are
no steel doors at this level, according to the ITER design. An
average volumetric fraction of steel rebar for the walls is taken
as 2.74\,\%.

{\em B2 level external walls}. The wall height for the level B2 is
5.55~m. The volumetric fractions of steel rebar for the north,
west, south, and east walls at the level B2 are, correspondingly,
2.49, 2.55, 2.45 and 2.03\,\%.

{\em B2 level cryostat support}. The cryostat support is a
cylindrical structure located in section S2. The cylinder wall is
1.5~m thick with a volumetric steel fraction of 8.27\,\%. Between
the support and the bioshield, vertical stiffening crosswalls are
placed radially with a 20-degree step. Every crosswall is 1 m
thick with a volumetric steel fraction of 12.3\,\%.

{\em B2 level internal walls}. A set of internal walls placed at
the level external regions has been added to the model. The wall

4.27 to 4.62\,\%. At the slab periphery the volumetric fraction of
steel rebar varies in the range from 1.9 to 3.88\,\%.

{\em B1 level bioshield}. The bioshield at the level B1 is a
regular polyhedron structure with 18 sides and rectangular
openings. Each regular sector of the bioshield consists of four
components: two vertical columns and two horizontal plates. The
volumetric steel fractions for the vertical components are equal
to 5.35\,\%. The volumetric steel fractions of the upper and lower
plates correspond to those of the section S3 (see Fig.~4) of the
slab central zones at the levels B1 and L1, i.~e. 5.21 and
7.06\,\%, respectively.

{\em B1 level port cell walls and doors}. The port cell walls and
doors at the level B1 form a regular structure. A regular sector
(1/18) includes walls, columns and one steel door. The volumetric
fractions of the components are evaluated in the range from 3.14
to 5.44\,\% and 100\,\% for steel doors.

the level periphery mostly near the slab opening. The volumetric
steel fractions of the walls vary in the range from 1.8 to
4.1\,\%. The doors are 100\,\% steel.

{\bf A.3. Level L1}

The main peculiarity of level L1 (see Fig.~5,~$c$) is the presence
of the Diagnostic (DNBI) and Heating Neutral Beam Injectors
(HNBIs). So, the bioshield is designed to fit openings for the
vacuum vessel (VV) equatorial ports, including the VV injector
ports. Also, the area near the injectors is free from port cell
walls.

{\em L1 level slab}. The L1 slab thickness is 0.9~m. The slab has
been modeled via hexahedral segments. The slab model takes into
account the slab opening at the north side. Within the subsections
S41--S46 (see Fig.~4) the volumetric fraction of steel rebar is
evaluated in the range from 3.1 to 4.6\,\%. At the slab periphery
the volumetric fraction of steel rebar varies in the range from
1.7 to 4.2\,\%.

{\em L1 level bioshield}. The bioshield at the level L1 consists
of a set of regular sectors and three injector sectors. The
volumetric fractions of steel rebar vary in the range from 2.0 to
7.1\,\%.

{\em L1 level port cell walls and doors}. A 20-degree sector of
the cell walls and doors as a local model has been rotated in the
toroidal direction to produce a 260-degree regular structure. The
volumetric fractions of steel rebar vary in the range from 2.1 to
5.5\,\%. The doors are 100\,\% steel.

have been introduced in the model. The walls connect the northern
external wall of the building and the port cell walls. The
volumetric steel fractions for the internal walls vary in the
range from 1.1 to 4.5\,\%.

Three radial rows of three columns each are located between NBIs
at the northern side of level L1. The volumetric steel fractions
of columns in a row vary as 1.6, 2.2 and 1.1\,\% in the radial
direction.

{\bf A.4. Level L2}

The level L2 (see Fig.~5, $d$) correlates with the level of the VV
upper ports.

{\em L2 level slab}. A part of the L2 level slab is absent due to
the presence of the injectors at the levels L1 and L2. The slab
thickness is equal to 0.8~m.

The slab can be conditionally divided into two major parts: the
inner circle covering subsections S41--S46, and the periphery
formed by the rest slab subsections. An average volumetric steel
fraction is evaluated as 4.2\,\% for the inner circle and 2.0\,\%
for the periphery.

{\em L2 level bioshield}. The volumetric steel fractions of the
columns and plates of the bioshield are equal to 7.5 and 6.9\,\%,
respectively.

{\em L2 level port cell walls and doors}. A 20-degree regular

and east walls for the level L2 are, correspondingly, 2.9, 1.9,
1.9 and 1.85\,\%.

{\em L2 level internal walls, doors and columns}. Internal walls
are introduced in the model at the level L2. The walls surround
the floor hole for the H/DNB injectors, located at the level L1.
The volumetric steel fractions vary in the range from 1.2 to
4.0\,\%. The door on the wall is 100\,\% steel.

The L1--L2 columns located surrounding the H/DNB injectors have a
volumetric steel fraction of 2.6\,\%.

{\bf A.5. Level L3}

The level L3 (see Fig.~5, $e$) correlates with the upper level of
the machine (the top of the cryostat), therefore no access to the
ports is needed.

{\em L3 level slab}. The slab thickness is 0.8~m. The L3 slab has
been updated in order to take into consideration the slab opening
at the region of the northern external wall. For the inner circle
the volumetric steel fractions are of 6.4\,\% (northern part) and
3.7\,\% (rest part of the ring), for the slab periphery ---
4.5\,\% (northern part), 2.0\,\% (for the rest).

{\em L3 level bioshield}. The bioshield height at level L3 varies
from 6 to 8~m, if measured from the L3 level slab, due to its
connection to the bioshield lid counterpart. The thickness of the
bioshield at the level L3 is 1.65~m.

The volumetric steel fraction of the bioshield located in section
S3 (see Fig.~4) has been taken as 3.9\,\% above the slab and
6.1\,\% for its part coinciding with the L3 level slab.

{\em L3 level cell walls}. A cell wall structure has been
simplified to a cylinder with a thickness of 1.15~m. The
volumetric steel fraction of 2.9\,\% is taken as an average value
for the walls located in section S4 (see Fig.~4).

{\em L3 level external walls}. The external wall height for the
level L3 varies in the range from 7.8 to 12.5~m. The volumetric
steel fraction of the north, west, south, and east walls for the
level L3 are, correspondingly, 2.2, 2.1, 2.1 and 2.1\,\%.

{\em L3 internal walls and columns}. The internal wall is parallel
to the western external wall over the entire level L3 and has the
volumetric steel fraction of 2.4\,\%.

The internal walls have also been added around a vertical
passageway near the northern external wall. The volumetric steel
fraction of the walls is 2.0\,\%, the door is 100\,\% steel. The
volumetric steel fraction for columns is 2.1\,\%.

{\bf A.6. Level L4}

{\em L4 level slab and bioshield lid}. The L4 level slab (see
Fig.~5, $f$, pos.~{\em 1}) is 1~m thick. At this level the
separate slab parts differ in height of about 2~m.

The volumetric fraction of steel rebar in the slab has been
estimated as its maximal value of 2.7\,\% for the elevated part
and 2.9\,\% for the rest.

The bioshield lid ({\em 14}) is represented as an 18-hedral
structure positioned in section S3, with a thickness of 1.4~m and
a volumetric steel fraction of 4.3\,\%.

{\em L4 level shielding platforms}. The northern and southern
shielding platforms, located\linebreak\newpage\noindent near the
bioshield lid ({\em 15}), are steel frames 20~mm thick each. For
the northern shielding platform the volumetric steel fraction is
2.5\,\%, for the southern shielding platform --- 3.2\,\%.

The shielding platforms are mounted above the floor on steel
trussworks. The trussworks have been modeled as hexahedra with the
steel fraction taken as a ratio of the trusswork volume to the
hexahedron volume.

{\em L4 level external wall}. The L4 level external walls
(pos.~{\em 3}) form a rectangular structure located at the east
side of the tokamak building. The wall thickness is 1.5~m.

The volumetric steel fractions are equal to 2.1\,\% for the
northern and eastern walls, 2.2\,\% for the southern, and 3.0\,\%
for the western walls.

{\bf A.7. Levels L5--R2}

{\em L5 level}. The L5 level (see Fig.~5, $f$) is represented as a
set of closed premises, located at the western part of the tokamak
building. They occupy the subsections S52, S57, S54 and partially
subsections S46, S51, S61 and S60 (see Fig.~4). The level includes
the slab (pos.~{\em 1}), walls ({\em 3}) and overhanging columns
({\em 10}).

The slab thickness is 0.8~m. The volumetric steel fraction for the
slab is 2.7\,\%.

The thickness of the walls varies in the range from 0.75 to 1~m.
The volumetric steel fractions for the northern, southern, western
and eastern walls at the level L5 are equal to 2.0, 2.1, 2.1 and
3.0\,\%, correspondingly.

The SIC rooms shown in Fig.~5, $f$ (pos.~{\em 16}) are also the
structures of level L5. Steel plates with a thickness of 30~mm are
located at the bottom of the SIC rooms and supported by beams. The
volumetric steel fraction is 2.8\,\% for the SIC room ceiling and
walls and 2.0\,\% for the BHDPE ceiling and walls. The SIC room
neutronic insulation from the bottom has the volumetric steel
fraction equal to 2.1\,\%.

{\em R1 level}. The R1 level (see Fig.~5, $g$) includes separate
parts of the slab, positioned in the eastern and western parts of
the building, the northern wall, the overhanging columns and
closed auxiliary rooms in the north-east part of the building.

The thickness of the northern wall is 0.75~m. The volumetric steel
fraction for the northern wall (taking into account the fabricated
metals fixed at the wall) is estimated as 3.2\,\%. The thickness
of the eastern and western parts of slab is 1.2 and 0.6~m,
correspondingly. The volumetric steel fraction is equal to 2.0 and
2.7\,\%, respectively.

The filling factor for the columns (see Fig.~5, $g$, pos.~{\it
11}) is taken as 4\,\%.

The volumetric fractions of steel rebar for separate structures of
auxiliary rooms are evaluated in the range from 2.0 to 2.1\,\%.

{\em R2 level}. The R2 level includes side (eastern and western)
and rear (northern) walls (see Fig.~5,~$g$, pos.~{\em 3}) as well
as the roof ({\em 13}) with a system of the trussworks ({\em 12})
and stiffness ribs. The thickness of the roof and walls is 0.18~m.

The volume of steel trussworks placed under the roof has been
estimated as 34.42~m$^3$, while the region occupied by trussworks
has a volume of 17353~m$^3$. So, in the model the volumetric steel
fraction of solids for this region is taken as 0.2\,\%.

For the northern wall the volumetric steel fraction is about
1\,\%.

For every side wall the volumetric steel fraction is evaluated as
7\,\%.

{\bf A.8. Excavation support structures}

Excavation support structures envelop all the three buildings of
the tokamak complex on a ground level (see Figs~2, 7).

{\em Seismic isolation basemat (slab)}. The seismic isolation
basemat is a plate made of concrete with steel rebar with a
dimension of 84.8~m in the north-south direction and 120.6~m in
the east-west direction. The basemat thickness is 1.5~m.
Anti-seismic bearings are omitted in this model. The volumetric
fraction of steel rebar is 2\,\%.

{\em Excavation support structure walls}. Dimensions of the inner
array are 84.8~m in the north-south direction and 120.6~m in the
east-west direction. The thickness of the external wall of the pit
varies from 0.5 to 1.5~m downward. In the model the maximal
thickness of 1.5~m has been taken. The wall height is 16.35~m. The
lower portion of the northern wall has a thickness of 1.25~m. The
volumetric fraction of steel rebar for the walls is 1.6\,\%.

Excavation support structures are seen at the bottom of Fig.~7. A
room is made in the pit for the buildings {\em 74} and {\em 14}
(see Fig.~2) omitted in MMTC-2.2.
