{\leftskip=7mm\noindent Based on the Gurtin---Murdoch
surface/interface elasticity theory, the article investigates the
effect of nonlinear terms in the boundary perturbation method on
stress concentration near the curvilinear bimaterial interface
taking into account plane strain conditions. The authors consider
the 2D boundary value problem for the infinite two-component plane
under uniaxial tension. The interface domain is assumed to be a
negligibly thin layer with the elastic properties differing from
those of the bulk materials.  Using the boundary perturbation
method, the authors determined a semi-analytical solution taking
into account non-linear approximations. In order to verify this
solution, the corresponding boundary value problem was solved
using the finite element method where the interface layer is
modelled by the truss elements. It was shown that the effect of
the amplitude-to-wavelength ratio of surface undulation on the
stress concentration is nonlinear. This should be taken into
account even for small perturbations. It was also found that the
convergence rate of the derived solution increases with an
increase in the relative stiffness coefficient of the bimaterial
system and, conversely, decreases with an increase of the
amplitude-to-wavelength ratio.

{\bf Introduction.}  The formation of the geometrical patterns in
the interface region of the bimaterial systems is a well-known
phenomena %on
[1--3]. Various modern manufacturing techniques allow
to accurately control the morphological surface modifications at
the micro- and nanoscale [4, 5]. In many applications, a material
design lets to achieve the improvements in mechanical, optical and
electronic properties of products.  However, due to the mismatch
of thermal and mechanical properties in the dissimilar materials
of heterostructures, stress concentrations appear near the rough
interface. Variations in working or environment temperature may
generally increase the stress level, which would result in
microcracks nucleation and delamination in the stress
concentration regions. Therefore, it is very essential for failure
prediction to accurately define stress distribution along the
curved interfaces.

In past decades, a number of studies have been conducted, where
the stress concentration caused by surface or interface
irregularities was considered [6--14]. But these studies have been
focused on the case of macroscale roughness and didn’t take into
account the surface/interface stress, assuming it insignificant
compared to the external loading. However, both experimental and
theoretical results demonstrate that surface effects become
important in mechanical and physical behavior of solids at the
nanoscale. It was observed that at the nanoscale material
properties depend on a specimen size. In particular, Cammarata and
Sieradzki theoretically predicted effective elastic modulus
enhancement/reduction of 20~\%, when the thickness of the film
reduces to below 5 nm [15]. Fartash et al. confirmed this result
by the experiments for several multilayered metal films [16]. In
studies of Sun and Zhang, it was demonstrated by atomistic
simulation that the values of elastic constants of thin films are
thickness dependent and approach those of the bulk as the film
thickness increases [17].

In order to understand the size dependency of mechanical
properties at the nanoscale, Gurtin and Murdoch developed the
surface elasticity theory by modelling the surface phase as two
dimensional membrane with elastic moduli differing from those of
the bulk material [18, 19]. As a result, the stress-strain
constitutive equations for the surface region were formulated. The
conditions of mechanical equilibrium for solid surface were
described by the generalized Young---Laplace equation yielding to
non-classical boundary conditions. Recently, the Gurtin---Murdoch
model has been applied to formulation of boundary value problems
(BVP) for nanosized structures [20--28]. The general mathematical
investigation of BVP in the linear elasticity with surface
stresses is presented in the work of Altenbach et al. [29]. The
Gurtin---Murdoch theory was generalized by Steigmann and Ogden
[30, 31] incorporating the effect of surface bending stiffness and
was used in [32, 33].  It should be pointed out that a few more
models can be found in the relevant literature considering the
effect of surface/interface elasticity in solids [34, 35].

It is worth noting that most of the previous studies have been
focused on the structural elements with defect-free surfaces and
interfaces despite the fact that the perfectly flat surfaces in
solids at the nanoscale is just a hypothetical situation [5]. In
[36--38], the analysis of the     effective elastic properties of
solids with nanoscale surface roughness was performed. However, as
it was mentioned above, it is very important to analyze the stress
state around the surface topological defects to predict the
material failure. For this purpose, the boundary perturbation
method (BPM) has been used extensively [39--41]. It should be
noted that only the linear approximation of the BPM was analysed
in these works. Considering the problem of interfacial stresses in
bimaterial composites with nanosized relief, Vakaeva et al. showed
that  the convergence of linear BPM become worse with the
increasing of amplitude-to-wavelength ratio [42]. Motivated by
these results, we decided to study the effect of nonlinear terms
in BPM on the stress concentration near the nanopatterned
bimaterial interface.

%%%    PROBLEM FORMULATION
%%%

%\vspace{0.3cm}

{\bf Problem formulation.} We consider the 2D problem for an
elastic isotropic bimaterial with slightly perturbated interface
under the uniaxial tension (Figure~1). The elastic properties of
the interface differ from those of the bulk materials. In
according to simplified  Gurtin---Murdoch model of
surface/interface elasticity [18, 19], it is represented as a
negligibly thin layer $\Gamma$ coherently bonded to the bulk
phases $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ without slipping:

\begin{equation}
    \label{surf}%1
    \begin{array}{c}
        \Gamma=\left\{ z:\,\,z\equiv\zeta=x_1+i\varepsilon f(x_1) \right\},\quad
        B_1= \left\{z:\,\,x_{2}>\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\}, \\ \\
        B_2= \left\{z:\,\,x_{2}<\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\},\quad f(x_1)=-a\cos{(bx_1)},
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $a$ is the perturbation wavelength; $b=2\pi/a$ is the wavenumber; $\varepsilon=A/a$ is the amplitude-to-wavelength ratio which we consider as a small parameter, i.~e. $0<\varepsilon \ll1$, and $z=x_1+ix_2$ is a complex variable where ($(x_1, x_2)$ are the Cartesian coordinates and $i^2=-1$).

%        tension}
%        \label{2sl}
%    \end{center}
%\end{figure}

To describe the elastic behavior of the interface domain we use
the simplified constitutive equations of Gurtin---Murdoch model
neglecting the effect of residual interface stress [18, 19]. Due
to the plane strain conditions, we derive the following scalar
form:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{gurmur1}%2
    \tau(\zeta)=\sigma^s_{tt}=M_s\varepsilon^s_{tt}(\zeta),\quad M_s=\lambda_s+2\mu_s,\quad\zeta\in\Gamma,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent here $\varepsilon^s_{tt}$ and $\sigma^s_{tt}$  are the
nonvanishing components of the interface strain and the first
Piola---Kirchhoff interface stress tensor, respectively;
$\lambda_s$ and $\mu_s$ are the interface Lam\'{e} constants.

Hooke's law for bulk materials in the case of plane strain can be written as

\begin{equation}
    \label{hook}%3
    \begin{array}{c}
        \sigma_{nn}(z)=(\lambda_j+2\mu_j )\varepsilon_{nn}(z)+\lambda_j\varepsilon_{tt}(z), \quad
        \sigma_{tt}(z)=(\lambda_j+2\mu_j)\varepsilon_{tt}(z)+\lambda_j\varepsilon_{nn}(z),
        \\ \\ \sigma_{nt}(z) = 2\mu_j\varepsilon_{nt}(z),  \quad z \in B_j,\quad j=\left\{ 1,2\right\},
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\sigma_{nn},\sigma_{tt},\sigma_{nt}$ and $\varepsilon_{nn},\varepsilon_{tt},\varepsilon_{nt}$ are the components of bulk stress and strain tensors, respectively, defined  in the local Cartesian coordinates $(n,t)$ (vectors $\mathbf{n}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are the normal and tangential to the interface  $\Gamma$),
    $\lambda_j$ and $\mu_j$ are the Lam\'{e} constants for the bulk phase $B_j$.

Since we assumed that the interphase layer and the bulk materials are coherent, the complex displacement vector is continuous at the interface:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{cohesion}%4
    \Delta u(\zeta)=u^{+}(\zeta)-u^{-}(\zeta)=0, \quad \zeta\in\Gamma,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent here $u^{\pm}=\lim\limits_{z\to\zeta\pm i0}u(z)$, $u(z)=u_1(z)+iu_2(z)$, $u_1$ and $u_2$ are the displacements along axes of the Cartesian coordinates ($x_1, x_2$).

In the case of the simplified Gurtin---Murdoch model, the
kinematic boundary con\-di\-tion is formulated on the basis of
generalized Young---Laplace law:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{yl}%5
    \Delta\sigma_n(\zeta)=\sigma_n^{+}(\zeta)-\sigma_n^{-}(\zeta) =-\kappa\tau+i\frac 1{h}\frac {d\tau(\zeta)}{dx_1}, \quad \zeta\in\Gamma,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where  $\sigma_n^{\pm}=\lim\limits_{z\to\zeta\pm i0}\sigma_n(z)$, $\sigma_n(z)=\sigma_{nn}(z)+i\sigma_{nt}(z)$, $\kappa$ and $h$  are the curvature and metric coefficient of the interface $\Gamma$, respectively.

At infinity, the stresses
$\sigma_{\alpha\beta}\;(\alpha\beta=\{1,2\})$ in coordinates
$(x_{1},x_{2})$ and the rotation angle $\omega$  are specified as
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{infinity}%6
    \lim\limits_{{x_2} \to \pm \infty}\sigma _{22}= \lim\limits_{{x_2} \to \pm \infty}\sigma _{12}=\lim\limits_{{x_2} \to  \pm \infty } \omega =0, \quad\lim\limits_{{x_2} \to  \pm \infty }
    \sigma_{11}  = T_j,\quad j=\{1,2\}.
\end{equation}


%%%
%%%    BOUNDARY PERTURBATION
%%%


%\vspace{0.3cm}

{\bf Boundary perturbation approach.} According to [40], the
solution of the BVP (\ref{surf})--(\ref{infinity}), specifically
the stress $\sigma_n$ and displacement $u$ complex vectors, can be
derived using Goursat---Kolosov complex potentials $\Phi_j$ and
$\Upsilon_j$:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{mus}%7
        G(z,\eta_j) \!=\! \eta_j\Phi_j(z)+\overline{\Phi_j(z)} -\!\left(\Upsilon_j(\overline{z})\! +\!\overline{\Phi_j(z)}
     \!   -\!\left( z\! -\! \overline{z} \right)\overline{\Phi_j^{\prime}(z)} \right)e^{- 2i\alpha},
        \,z \in B_j,\, j=\left\{ 1,2\right\},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is the angle between axis $t$- and
$x_1$-axis,  the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the
argument. The functions $\Phi_j$, $\Upsilon_1$ and $\Upsilon_2$
are holomorphic in the regions $B_j$
$\widetilde{B_1}=\left\{z:\,\,x_{2}>-\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\}$
and
    $\widetilde{B_2}=\left\{z:\,\,x_{2}<-\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\}$, respectively.

The function $G$ is defined as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{G}%8
    G(z,\eta_j)=\left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
        \sigma_{n}, & \eta_j=1, \\ \\
        \displaystyle{-2\mu_j\frac{du}{dz}}, & \eta_j=-\varkappa_j,
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

\noindent here $\varkappa_j=3-4\nu_j$ and $\nu_j$ is the Poisson's
ratio for elastic domain $B_j$.

Substituting (\ref{mus}) into boundary conditions (\ref{cohesion}) and (\ref{yl}), we rewrite these equations in the terms of complex potentials $\Phi_j$ and $\Upsilon_j$. The main issue here is to express explicitly the complex potentials in terms of interface stress $\tau$. It is easy to obtain such expressions in the case of the planar boundary [43]. However, it is impossible to do this in the case of curved boundary as $\zeta\neq\overline{\zeta}$. For this purpose, we use the BPM which has been applied recently in several publications to simplify BVP problems associated with complicated geometry and allowed to derive the analytic approximations of considered solutions [7--11, 39--41].

Employing BPM, we expand the functions $\Phi_j$, $\Upsilon_j$, and
$\tau$ in power series in small parameter $\varepsilon$ as it was
done in [40]:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq13}%9
    \begin{array}{c}
\displaystyle\Phi_j(z)\!=\!\!\!\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty
\!\frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\Phi_{j (m)}(z),\, \displaystyle
\Upsilon_j(z)\!=\!\!\!\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\!
\frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\Upsilon_{j (m)}(z),\, \displaystyle
        \tau(\zeta) \!=\!\!\!\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\! \frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\tau_{(m)}(\zeta), \,  j=\{1,2\}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}


In addition, each function $\tau_{(m)}$, and boundary values of
functions $\Phi_{j (m)}$ and $\Upsilon_{j (m)}$ are represented in
Taylor series in the vicinity of line $x_2 = 0$, considering $x_1$
as a parameter:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq28}%10
    \begin{array}{c}
        \displaystyle\Phi_{j (m)}(\zeta)=\sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty\frac{\left[i\varepsilon f(x_1) \right]^k}   {k!}\Phi_{j (m)}^{(k)}(x_1),\quad
        \displaystyle\Upsilon_{j (m)}(\overline{\zeta})= \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\left[ -i\varepsilon
        f(x_1)\right]^k}{k!}\Upsilon_{j (m)}^{(k)}(x_1), \\ \\
        \displaystyle \tau_{(m)}(\zeta)=\sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty\frac{\left[i\varepsilon f(x_1)\right]^k}
        {k!}\tau_{(m)}^{(k)}(x_1),\,\,\,  j=\{1,2\}.
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

Also one can write the power series for known functions:
\begin{equation}
    \label{ser3}%11
    \begin{array}{c}
        e^{-2i\alpha_0}=1+2\sum\limits_{m = 0}^\infty\left( -i\varepsilon f^{\prime}(x_1) \right)^{m+1},\\ \\
        \kappa(x_1)=\displaystyle\varepsilon f^{\prime\prime}(x_1)\left[1+\sum\limits_{m=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^m}
        {m!}\frac{(2m-1)!!}{2^m}\left(\varepsilon f^{\prime}(x_1)\right)^{2m}\right],\\ \\
        h^{-1}(x_1)=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^m}{m!}\frac{(2m+1)!!}{2^m}\left(\varepsilon
        f^{\prime}(x_1)\right)^{2m}.
    \end{array}
\end{equation}


After substitution (\ref{eq13})--(\ref{ser3}) into boundary
conditions, which were previously written in the terms of the
complex potentials on the basis of equation~(\ref{mus}), and
equating the coefficients of $\varepsilon^m$, $m=\{0,1,\dots\}$,
we derive two recurrent sequences of boundary equations associated
already with the flat boundary $\Gamma_{(0)}=\left\{
z:\,\,z=x_1\right\}$. From these equations, we obtain the integral
dependencies of functions $\Phi_{j (m)}$ and $\Upsilon_{j (m)}$ on
$\tau^{\prime}_{(m)}$ using the solution of Riemann---Hilbert
problem:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{potentials}%12
    \begin{array}{c}
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}

            \Upsilon_{1(m)}(z)=-\Phi_{2(m)}(z)+\Sigma_m(z)+O^1_m, & \mathop{\rm Im}z < 0,
        \end{array}\right.\\[0.6cm]
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \Upsilon_{2(m)}(z)=\displaystyle\frac{\mu_2\varkappa_1\Sigma_m(z)+V_m(z)}{\mu_1+
            \mu_2\varkappa_1}+O^2_m, & \mathop{\rm Im}z > 0,\\[0.4cm]

In the case of zero-order approximation, $F_{0}=0$ and we arrive
to the homogeneous equations (13), which have only trivial
solution $\tau^{\prime}_{(0)}(x_1)=0$ corresponding to the problem
of bimaterial with perfectly flat interface $\Gamma_{(0)}$ and
piecewise uniform stress state:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \label{zero}%20
    \Phi_{j(0)}(z)=\Upsilon_{j(0)}(z)=T_j/4,\quad \tau_{(0)}(x_1)=\frac{M_s(\varkappa+1)T_2}{8\mu_2}, \nonumber \\
    \\
    \sigma_{11(0)}(z)=T_{j},\,\,T_{1}=\displaystyle\frac{\mu_{1}(\varkappa_{2}+1)}{\mu_{2}(\varkappa_{1}+1)}T_{2},\quad z\in\Omega_{j},\quad j=\{1,2\} \nonumber.
\end{eqnarray*}

The nonhomogeneous equations (13), i.~e. for $m>0$, are solved on
the basis of the properties of Cauchy-type integrals letting to
define the complex potentials $\Phi_{j (m)}$ and $\Upsilon_{j
(m)}$. Taking into account the expression (\ref{G}) and power
series for complex potentials (\ref{eq13}), we can write the
following sequence:

\begin{equation*}
    \label{str}%21
    \begin{array}{c}
        \sigma_{nn (m)}(z)+i\sigma_{nt (m)}(z) = \Phi_{j (m)}(z)+\overline{\Phi_{j (m)}(z)}\, - \\
        \\-\left(\Upsilon_{j (m)}(\overline{z} )+\overline{\Phi_{j (m)}(z)} - \left(z - \overline{z} \right)
        \overline{\Phi_{j (n)}^{\prime}(z)} \right)e^{-2i\alpha}, \\ \\
         \sigma_{tt (m)}(z)+\sigma_{nn (m)}(z)=4\varepsilon{\rm Re\,}\Phi_{j (m)}(z),\quad z \in B_j,
         \quad m=0,1,\dots,
         \quad j=\{1,2\}.
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}

And, finally, derive the expressions for stress tensor components
in the terms of power series in small parameter $\varepsilon$:

\begin{equation*}
    \label{solutionStress}%22
    \begin{array}{c}
        \displaystyle\sigma_{nn}(z)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\sigma_{nn(m)}(z),
        \quad\sigma_{tt}(z)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\sigma_{tt(m)}(z),
        \quad\sigma_{nt}(z)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\varepsilon^m}{m!}\sigma_{nt(m)}(z).
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}

{\bf Numerical results.} In order to verify the obtained solution,
we use the finite element method (FEM) where the finite domain is
considered employing the symmetry boundary conditions. The finite
element model is schematically shown in Figure~2, {\it a}. The
bulk phases are meshed with 6-node triangular elements for plane
problems of linear elasticity. As it was mentioned above, the
interface layer is considered as 1D domain with elastic properties
that differ from the bulk ones. To model it in the framework of
FEM formulation, we consider a 2-node truss element with unitary
cross-section area $A$ and Young's modulus equal to $E_t=M_s/A$
[44]. The Figure~2, {\it b} shows the refined mesh around the
interface.

For the numerical calculations, we examine the stress
concentration at the curved surface of aluminum substrate with
Lam\'{e} constants equal to $\lambda_2=58.17$~GPa and
$\mu_2=26.13$ GPa covered by a coating with an arbitrary shear
modulus $\mu_1$.  For simplicity, the Poisson's ratios are assumed
to be equal $\nu_1=\nu_2$. This assumption is often considered in
metal-on-metal heteroepitaxial systems and allows to analyse the
effect of the substrate through the only one parameter,
coating-to-substrate stiffness ratio $r$.  The interface effect is
presented by the parameters $\lambda_{s}=6.851$~N/m,
$\mu_{s}=-0.376$~N/m [45].

The dependence of stress concentration coefficient on parameter
$\varepsilon$ for different orders of  approximate solution within
BPM as well as calculated with FEM is plotted in Figure~3.   It
shows that the accuracy of the linear BPM decreases with the
increasing of amplitude-to-wavelength ratio $\varepsilon$, and we
have to take into consideration high-order approximate solutions.
For $a=20$ nm, $M_s=6.099$ nm, $r=0.1$ and $\varepsilon=0.1$, the
relative difference between first- and second-order approximations
is equal to 30\,\%. And the difference between fouth- and
fifth-order approximations is equal to 2\,\%. The relative
difference between FEM solution and fifth-order approximation for
the same values of parameters is 15\,\%.

The variation of the stress concentration with the stiffness ratio
$r$ is shown in Figure~4 in the case, when $M_s=6.099$, $a=20$ nm
and $\varepsilon=0.1$. One can see that the convergence rate of
BPM solution increases with increasing of the stiffness ratio $r$.
The relative difference between first- and second-order
approximations is 20\,\% and between fouth- and fifth-order
approximations is 2\,\% for $r=0.1$. For $r=0.9$ the consideration
of nonlinear BPM terms does not have a significant effect on the
solution: the relative difference between first- and second-order
approximations is equal 3\,\%. When the stiffness ratio $r$
increase from 0.1 to 0.9, the relative difference between
FEM-solution and fifth-order approximations of BPM decrease from
14 to 3\,\%.

{\bf Conclusion}. In the present paper, we have studied the effect
of nonlinear terms in the framework of boudary perturbation method
solution on stress concentration near the nanopatterned bimaterial
interface. Taking into account the plane strain conditions, the 2D
boundary value problem was considered for the infinite
two-component plane under uniaxial tension. Based on
Gurtin---Murdoch surface/interface elasticity theory, the
interface domain was modelled as a negligibly thin layer with the
elastic properties differing from those of the bulk materials.
Using specific approach developed in [40], we received
semi-analytical solution taking into account non-linear
approximations of boundary perturbation method. In order to verify
the derived solution, the corresponding boundary value problem was
solved by finite element method, where the interface layer was
modelled by the truss elements. It was shown that the effect of
the amplitude-to-wavelength ratio of surface undulation on the
stress concentration is nonlinear. Also, we found that the
convergence rate of the derived solution increases with the
increasing of the stiffness ratio of bimaterial system and, vice
versa, decreases with the increasing of the
amplitude-to-wavelength ratio.
