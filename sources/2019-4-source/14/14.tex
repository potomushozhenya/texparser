{\bf Introduction.} The computational geometry have now received a
new impetus in connection with the development of location and
navigation technologies. One of classic problems is the problem of
detecting a location where a fixed-size rectangle should be
placed, so that it covers the maximum number of points.

In~[1] the continuation of this problem for the case where the
objective is to maximize the area covered by a rectangle on a set
of convex non-intercepted polygons is presented.

This paper proposes a further development of this problem for the
case,  where polygons are not necessarily convex, can together
cover the entire space under consideration (i. e. have no
``holes''). And the goal is to maximize the weighted area covered
by the rectangle.

This problem arises during the process of determining the places
of forest felling, when the planned cutting area can be modelled
by a rectangle, and the polygons describe the spots with the same
forest taxations, tightly adjacent to each other. For each spot, a
stock of wood per hectare is known, which can be considered
equally distributed over the entire area of spot. A logger is
interested in maximizing the volume of harvested wood. Therefore,
the cutting area should be located so that the total volume of
harvested wood on it is the maximum~[2]. This corresponds to the
maximum weighted area covered by the rectangle.

Now we describe the exact formulation of the problem.

A finite set of polygons of arbitrary shape and size (with the
exception of self-intersecting polygons) $P=\{p_i\}_1^n$ is
defined on the plane (Figure~1).

}
\end{figure}



Polygon $p_i$ is defined by a set of points corresponding to the
vertices of polygon $\{v_{ij}=(x_{ij}, y_{ij})\}, j=1,...,n_i$,
where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of polygon $p_i$. The
sequence of points are ordered, the neighboring points define the
edges of a polygon  $a_{ij}=((x_{ij}, y_{ij}), (x_{ij+1},
y_{ij+1})), j=1,...,n_i$, where $n_i+1=1$, that is, the last point
joins the first point to form the closing edge of the polygon.


Two polygons can share edges. The inner areas of the polygons do
not intersect. Thus, the space covered by polygons may contain
``holes''.

Each point of the plane:

 $\bullet$~~~either belongs to the inner area of only one polygon;

  $\bullet$~~~or does not belong to any polygon;

  $\bullet$~~~or lies on the edge of one or two polygons;

  $\bullet$~~~or coincides with the vertex of one or more polygons.


It should be noted that a vertex of one polygon cannot lie on the
edge of another polygon, it is either the vertex of another
polygon or belongs to only one polygon.

Each polygon is characterized by a density (weight, expressed by
some value per unit area) $G_i$. At the edges of the polygon we
consider this value to be zero. At points that do not belong to
any polygon this value considered to be equal to zero. In Figure~1
the density of a polygon is indicated by the color saturation of
the polygon interior in grayscale. The darker the color, the
higher the density $G_i$ of  the polygon $p_i$.

It is necessary to find the location of the rectangle $R$, namely
the coordinates of the lower left corner of the rectangle $(x_0,
y_0)$, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes (Fi\-gu\-re~2),
and given sizes: $w$ is length along the axis $OX$, $h$ is length
along the axis $OY$, so that the weighted area $S(R)$ covered by
rectangle is maximal.


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{
\includegraphics[scale=1]{14/fig2}

\vskip 2mm {\small{\it Figure~2.} The location of the rectangle
$R$} }
\end{figure}





The weighted area is calculated as the sum of the parts of the
polygon areas that are covered by the rectangle multiplied by the
weights of the corresponding polygons:

$$S(R)=\sum_{p_i\cap R \neq \varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap R)},$$

\noindent where $S(\cdot)$ is a function of area.

In Figure~1 the rectangle should be placed so that it covers as
dark areas as possible.


{\bf Related works.} The described problem comes from the maximum
subarray problem, which is formulated as follows. Given an $M
\times N$ array of real numbers, find the maximum sum contained in
any rectangular subarray. This problem was first posed by
Grenander of Brown University in the two-dimensional space for
pattern detection in images and then he simplified it to one
dimension. In 1977 Kadane designed a linear time algorithm for
this problem in one dimension. Obviously, there is a simple
algorithm in $O((MN)^2)$ time for this problem in two dimensions.
The history of this problem is described by Bentley in~[3]. The
maximum subarray problem has applications in pattern
recognition~[4] and data mining~[5].

Tamaki and Tokuyama described a subcubic algorithm, by reducing
this problem to ``funny matrix multiplication'' and also they
developed an $\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm~[6]. The scalar
product and addition in matrix multiplication were replaced by
addition and max operation in these algorithms.

Takaoka designed an algorithm, which solves the maximum subarray
problem in $O(M^2N(\log\log M / \log M)^{1/2})$ time. Takaoka also
gave a practical algorithm, whose expected time is better than the
worst case time~[7].

Daliels, Milenkovic and Roth considered the geometric optimization
problem of finding the largest area axis-parallel rectangle of a
fixed size in an $n$-vertex general polygon~[8]. They considered
different cases based on the types of contacts between the
rectangle and the polygon. They obtained the following algorithm
time results: $\Theta(n)$ for $xy$-monotone polygons,
$O(n\alpha(n))$ for orthogonally convex polygons ($\alpha(n)$ is
the inverse of Ackermann's function), $O(n\alpha(n)\log n)$ for
horizontally (vertically) convex polygons, $O(n(\log n))$ for a
special type of horizontally convex polygon, $O(n(\log^2n))$ for
general polygons, in which there may be holes. A lower bound of
time $\Omega(n(\log n))$ is established for finding the largest
area rectangle of a fixed size  in both self-intersecting polygons
and general polygons with holes. Also, a lower bound of
$\Omega(n(\log n))$ and an upper bound of $O(n(\log^2n))$ for
general polygons were established.

Nandy and Bhattacharya proposed an unified algorithm for locating
the position of the plate which encloses the maximum (or the
minimum) number of objects~[9]. Also
they\linebreak\newpage\noindent extended their algorithm for
identifying a cuboid, i.~e., a rectangular parallelepiped that
encloses the maximum number of polyhedral objects in
$\mathbb{R}^3$.

Backurs, Dikkala and Tzamos studied max-weight rectangle in $d$
dimensions. This problem asks to find an axis parallel rectangle
that maximizes the total weight of the points it contains~[10].
Additionally, they provide an overview of the algorithms for
solving the maximum weight rectangles problem.

In their most recent paper~[1], Hussian and Trajcevski
investigated the problem of placing the rectangle so that the
total area coverage on the input set of polygons is maximized. The
proposed algorithm has a limitation: in an optimal solution at
least one side of the rectangle must contain a vertex of some
polygon. For the problem of a weighted area of rectangle, this
limitation may lead to a non-optimal solution. In addition, when
an area under consideration is completely filled with polygons
(without ``holes''), the problem of  detecting a location of the
rectangle with the maximum area degenerates, whereas the problem
of the detecting a location of the rectangle with the maximum
weighted area remains as a problem.

{\bf The main results.} The general algorithm for solving the
maximum weighted area problem includes the following steps:

1)\,\,cover the polygon area with a regular grid; calculate the
upper bound of weighted area of each grid cell;

2)\,\,arrange the cells in descending order of the upper bound;
choose the first cell from the ordered list;

3)\,\,place the rectangle $R$ so that the upper left corner of the
rectangle coincides the upper left corner of the current cell;

4)\,\,shift the rectangle to a local maximum of its weighted area
$S(R)$ by the coordinate-wise descent method;

5)\,\,if the current solution is better than the previously
obtained solutions, then remember it;

6)\,\,choose the next cell from the ordered list;

7)\,\,if the remembered value of the weighted area exceeds the
upper bound of the current cell, then finish the algorithm,
otherwise go to step 3.

Consider the first step of the algorithm.

We assume that the lengths of the sides $w$ and $h$ of the
rectangle $R$ are proportional to the given values $d_x$ and
$d_y$, i.~e.
$$
w = M\cdot d_x, \qquad h = N\cdot d_y,
$$
\noindent here $M$ and $N$ are natural numbers. Let the region
under consideration be divided by a regular grid into rectangular
cells $\Upsilon_{ij}$ ($i=1,\ldots,P$, $j=1,\ldots,Q$) with sides
$d_x$ and $d_y$.


Let $A_{ij}$ denote the weighted area of cell $\Upsilon _{ij}$:
$$
A_{ij} = \int\limits_{\Upsilon_{ij}} G(z) dz,
$$
\noindent where $G(z)$ is a density in the point $z$. We will
assume that $A_{ij}=0$ if $i<1$, or $i>P$, or $j<1$, or $j>Q$.

Let $S_{ij}$ be the weighted area of the rectangle $R_{ij}$ whose
upper left corner coincides with the upper left corner of the cell
$\Upsilon_{ij}$:
$$
S_{ij} = \sum_{p=i}^{i+M-1} \sum_{q=j}^{j+N-1} A_{pq}, \quad
i=1,\ldots,P-M+1, \quad j=1,\ldots,Q-N+1.
$$

Let $\Phi_{ij}$ ($i=1,\ldots,P-M+1$, $j=1,\ldots,Q-N+1$) denote
the region that includes rectangle $R_{ij}$ and all the grid's
cells around it:
$$
\Phi_{ij} = \bigcup_{
\begin{array}{c}
\scriptstyle
p = i-1,\ldots,i+M \\
\scriptstyle q = j-1,\ldots,j+N
\end{array}}
\Upsilon_{pq}.
$$

Let $G^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij}$ denote the maximum density of cells
from $\Phi_{ij}\setminus R_{ij}$. They are cells with row and
column numbers:
$$
(i-1,q)  \ \mbox{and} \ (i+M,q), \qquad q = j-1,\ldots,j+N,
$$
$$
(p,j-1) \ \mbox{and} \ (p,j+N), \qquad p = i,\ldots,i+M-1,
$$
and $G^{\mathrm{min}}_{ij}$ denote the minimum density of cells
with row and column numbers:
$$
(i,q) \ \mbox{and} \ (i+M-1,q), \qquad q = j,\ldots,j+N-1,
$$
$$
(p,j) \ \mbox{and} \  (p,j+N-1), \qquad p = i+1,\ldots,i+M-2.
$$


Then the upper bound $B_{ij}$ for weighted area of any rectangle
$R$ located in region $\Upsilon_{ij}$  is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_bound} B_{ij} = S_{ij} + (G^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij} -
G^{\mathrm{min}}_{ij})\cdot(M+N-1)\cdot d_x\cdot d_y.
\end{equation}


Consider in more detail the 4th step of the algorithm.

The idea of the method of coordinate-wise descent is as follows.
Step by step, the rectangle moves in one of four directions
parallel to the coordinate axes (left, right, upward, downward).
The value of the shift is determined based on the fact that the
set of polygons intersecting the rectangle has to remain
unchanged. The shift occurs at the maximum possible distance in
the direction in which the increment of the weighted area is the
maximum and positive. The algorithm stops, when the weighted area
increment in all directions becomes negative or equal to zero.

The algorithm more strictly is described as follows:

1.\,\,Two regions $\Theta_h$~--- a horizontal strip with a width
of $h$, and $\Theta_v$~--- a vertical strip with a width of
$w$~--- are defined. Within these strips the rectangle can be
shifted (Figure~3). Regions are formed by lines
$l_{\mathrm{right}}$, $l_{\mathrm{right}}$, $l_{\mathrm{top}}$,
$l_{\mathrm{bottom}}$, which are continuations of the sides of the
rectangle $R$. On the line $l_{\mathrm{left}}$ lies the left side
of the rectangle, on $l_{\mathrm{right}}$  lies the right side, on
$l_{\mathrm{top}}$ lies the top side, on $l_{\mathrm{bottom}}$
lies the bottom side.






2.\,\,For horizontal, and vertical shifts, the sets of stopping
points $V_h$, and $V_v$ are defined (Figure~3). The stopping
points are the points at which the sides of the rectangle should
stop moving further in that direction. All stopping points are
either at the vertices of polygons or lie on their edges.



3.\,\,For each of the four shift directions, the maximum shift
value is determined based on the coordinates of the stopping
points: $\Delta X_{\mathrm{left}}$, $\Delta X_{\mathrm{right}}$,
$\Delta Y_{\mathrm{up}}$, $\Delta Y_{\mathrm{down}}$ (Figure~4).


4.\,\,For each of the 4 shift directions, a weighted area's
increment is calculated based on the maximum shift value: $\Delta
S_{\mathrm{left}}$, $\Delta S_{\mathrm{right}}$, $\Delta
S_{\mathrm{up}}$, $\Delta S_{\mathrm{down}}$.

5.\,\,The maximum value is selected from four increments $\Delta
S_{\mathrm{max}}=\max\{\Delta S_{\mathrm{left}}, \Delta
S_{\mathrm{right}},$ $\Delta S_{\mathrm{up}}, \Delta
S_{\mathrm{down}}\}$.

6.\,\,If the maximum increment is greater than zero ($\Delta
S_{\mathrm{max}}>0$), the rectangle is shifted in the appropriate
direction (Figure~5), this changes the coordinates of the lower
left corner of the rectangle $(x_0, y_0)$. Transition to the first
step of the algorithm. Otherwise algorithm stops.

\end{figure}

Now we write formal expressions for each step of the algorithm.

Regions: $\Theta_h = \{(x,y)\ | (y<= y_0+h)\&(y>=y_0)\}$, and
$\Theta_v = \{(x,y)\ | (x>= x_0)\&(x<=x_0+w)\}$.

The set of stopping points are either the vertices of the polygons
or   possible inter\-sections of the sides of the rectangle $R$
with the edges of the polygons, when the rectangle is shifted.

The shift of the rectangle from local position to the intersection
with the stopping point guarantees a linear change of the
increment of the weighted area relative to the value of the shift,
since the set of polygons covered by the rectangle --- $P_0$ does
not change. When the stopping point is reached by the side of the
rectangle, during the movement the set $P_0$ could change.

The set of stopping points to shift the rectangle in horizontal
directions (left or right) is $V_{h}=\{(x,y)\in \Theta_h \ |\
\exists p_j\in P: \ (\exists v_{jk}: (x,y)=v_{jk})\ or\ (\exists
a_{jk}: \ (a_{jk}\cap l_{\mathrm{top}}=(x,y))\ or\ (a_{jk}\cap
l_{\mathrm{bottom}}=(x,y)))\}$.

The set of stopping points to shift the rectangle in vertical
directions (up or down) is $V_{v}=\{(x,y)\in \Theta_v \ |\ \exists
p_j\in P: \ (\exists v_{jk}: (x,y)=v_{jk})\ or\ (\exists a_{jk}: \
(a_{jk}\cap l_{\mathrm{left}}=(x,y))\ or\ (a_{jk}\cap
l_{\mathrm{right}}=(x,y)))\}$.

The maximum shift to the left $\Delta X_{\mathrm{left}}$ is
determined as a minimum of two numbers: the distance from the left
side of the rectangle to the nearest stopping point outside the
rectangle to the left of the left side of the rectangle, and the
distance from the right side of the rectangle to the nearest
stopping point inside the rectangle. If there are no stopping
points inside the rectangle, the distance from the right side is
not taken into account. If there are no stopping points outside
the rectangle, the distance from the left side is not taken into
account. The situation, when the set of stopping points is empty
($V_{h} = \varnothing$ or $V_{v} = \varnothing$), is impossible,
because the first step of the general algorithm guarantees the
intersection of the rectangle with at least one polygon ($P_0\neq
\varnothing$):


$$
\Delta X_{\mathrm{left}} = \min\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x_0-\max\{x: (x,t_y)\in V_{h} \  \&\ x<x_0\}, \\
x_0+w-\max\{ x: (x, y)\in V_{h} \ \& \  x>x_0\}
\end{array}
\right\}.$$

The maximum shift to the right $\Delta X_{\mathrm{right}}$ is
determined as a minimum of two numbers: the distance from the
right side of the rectangle to the nearest stopping point outside
the rectangle to the right of the right side of the rectangle, and
the distance from the left side of the rectangle to the nearest
stopping point inside the rectangle:

$$\Delta X_{\mathrm{right}} = \min\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\min\{x: (x,y)\in V_{h}\  \&\  x>x_0+w\}-x_0-w, \\
\min\{ x: (x, y)\in V_{h} \ \&\  x<x_0+w\}-x_0
\end{array}
\right\}.$$

The maximum upward shift $\Delta Y_{\mathrm{up}}$ is determined as
a minimum of two numbers: the distance from the top side of the
rectangle to the nearest stopping point outside the rectangle
above the top side of the rectangle, and the distance from the
bottom side of the rectangle to the nearest stopping point inside
the rectangle:

$$\Delta Y_{\mathrm{up}} = \min\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\min\{ y: (x, y)\in V_{v} \ \&\  y>y_0+h\}-y_0-h, \\
\min\{y: (x,y)\in V_{v} \ \& \  y<y_0+h\}-y_0
\end{array}
\right\}.$$

The maximum downward shift  $\Delta Y_{\mathrm{down}}$ is
determined as a minimum of two numbers: the distance from the
bottom side of the rectangle to the nearest stopping point outside
the rectangle below the bottom side of the rectangle, and the
distance from the top side of the rectangle to the nearest
stopping point inside the rectangle:

$$
\Delta Y_{\mathrm{down}} = \min\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
y_0-\max\{y: (x,y)\in V_{v} \ \&\  y<y_0\},\\
y_0+h-\max\{ y: (x, y)\in V_{v} \ \&\  y>y_0\}
\end{array}
\right\}.$$


In Figure~4 dotted lines indicate the maximum shifts of the
rectangle in each direction. You can see that the left shift is
limited to the point to the left of the rectangle, which is the
vertex of the polygon. The shift to the right is limited to the
point inside the rectangle, which is also the vertex of the
polygon. The upward shift is limited to the point that is the
intersection point of the polygon edge and the line
$l_{\mathrm{left}}$~--- the continuation of the left side of the
rectangle. The downward shift is limited to the point on the right
side of the rectangle, which is the intersection of the side of
the rectangle and the edge of the polygon.

When rectangle moves the rectangle area is changed by an amount
equal to the sum of the weighted areas of the parts of the
polygons. Each part of the polygon is a trapezoid (or triangle)
with bases parallel to the corresponding side of the rectangle,
and the same heights. Since the sum of the base lengths does not
change, the change in area is proportional to the height of the
trapezoids, and its heights are equal to the shift value.

The weighted area increment when shifted to the left is calculated
as

\begin{equation}
\label{F2} \Delta S_{\mathrm{left}}=\sum_{p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{left-left}}\neq\varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{left-left}})} - \sum_{p_i\cap R_{\mathrm{left-right}}
\neq\varnothing}\!\!{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap R_{\mathrm{left-right}})}.
\end{equation}
%
In (2) rectangle $R_{\mathrm{left-left}}$ has lower left corner in
point $(x_0-\Delta X_{\mathrm{left}},y_0)$, and upper right corner
in point $(x_0,y_0+h)$ (in Figure~4 it is a rectangle has left
adjacent to the left side of the rectangle $R$ indicated by a
solid line), rectangle $R_{\mathrm{left-right}}$ has lower left
corner in point $(x_0+w-\Delta X_{\mathrm{left}},y_0)$, and upper
right corner in point $(x_0+w,y_0+h)$ (in Figure~4 it is a
rectangle has left adjacent to the right side of the rectangle $R$
indicated by a solid line).

The weighted area increment when shifted to the right is
calculated as

\begin{equation}
\label{F3} \Delta S_{\mathrm{right}}=\sum_{p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{right-right}}\neq\varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{right-right}})} - \sum_{p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{right-left}}\neq\varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{right-left}})}.
\end{equation}
%
In formula (3) rectangle $R_{\mathrm{right-right}}$ has lower left
corner in point $(x_0+w,y_0)$, and upper right corner in point
$(x_0+w+\Delta X_{\mathrm{right}},y_0+h)$, rectangle
$R_{\mathrm{right-left}}$ has lower left corner in point
$(x_0,y_0)$, and upper right corner in point $(x_0+\Delta
X_{\mathrm{right}},y_0+h)$.

The weighted area increment when shifted upward is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\label{F4} \Delta S_{\mathrm{up}}=\sum_{p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{up-top}}\neq\varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{up-top}})} - \sum_{p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{up-bottom}}\neq\varnothing}{G_i\cdot S(p_i\cap
R_{\mathrm{up-bottom}})}.
\end{equation}
%
In (4) rectangle $R_{\mathrm{up-top}}$ has lower left corner in
point  $(x_0, y_0+h)$, and upper right corner in point
$(x_0+w,y_0+h+\Delta Y_{\mathrm{up}})$, rectangle
$R_{\mathrm{up-bottom}}$ has lower left corner in point
$(x_0,y_0)$, and upper right corner in point $(x_0+w,y_0+\Delta
Y_{\mathrm{up}})$.

The weighted area increment when shifted downward is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\label{F5} \Delta S_{\mathrm{down}}= \!  \!  \! \sum_{p_i\cap

In (5) rectangle $R_{\mathrm{down-bottom}}$ has lower left corner
in point  $(x_0, y_0-\Delta Y_{\mathrm{down}})$, and upper right
corner in point $(x_0+w,y_0)$, rectangle $R_{\mathrm{down-top}}$
has lower left corner in point  $(x_0,y_0+h-\Delta
Y_{\mathrm{down}})$, and upper right corner in point
$(x_0+w,y_0+h)$.

In Figure~6 the results of the coordinate-wise movement of the
rectangle from the initial location indicated by the solid line to
the optimal location indicated by the dashed line are presented.

The estimation of relative algorithm error $\delta$ can be
calculated as follows.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let $S^{\mathrm{opt}}$ is a weighted area of the optimal solution,
that locates in region $\Phi_{pq}$, $S^{\mathrm{alg}}$ is a
weighted area of algorithm solution. Let we know some solution
with weighted area $S^{\mathrm{good}}>0$. Define
$G^{\mathrm{good}}=\frac{S^{\mathrm{good}}}{w\cdot h}$~--- average
density in $R$ corresponding $S^{\mathrm{good}}$. Calculate
$\beta$ as $\frac{G^{\mathrm{max}}}{G^{\mathrm{good}}}$, where
$G^{\mathrm{max}}$ is a maximum density among all polygons.

Relative algorithm error $\delta$ satisfies the following
expression:

$$
\delta = \frac{S^{\mathrm{opt}} -
S^{\mathrm{alg}}}{S^{\mathrm{opt}}} \le \frac{S^{\mathrm{opt}} -
S^{\mathrm{alg}}}{S^{\mathrm{good}}}.
$$


Taking into account the upper bound~(\ref{eq_bound}) for
$S^{\mathrm{opt}}$, the expression can be proposed:

$$
\delta  \le \frac{S^{\mathrm{opt}} -
S^{\mathrm{alg}}}{S^{\mathrm{good}}}\le
\frac{S_{pq}+\left(G_{pq}^{\mathrm{max}}-G_{pq}^{\mathrm{min}}\right)\cdot\left(M+N-1\right)\cdot
d_x\cdot d_y- S^{\mathrm{alg}}}{G^{\mathrm{good}}\cdot M\cdot
N\cdot d_x\cdot d_y}\le
$$
$$
\le\frac{S_{pq}+G^{\mathrm{max}}\cdot\left(M+N-1\right)\cdot
d_x\cdot d_y- S^{\mathrm{alg}}}{G^{\mathrm{good}}\cdot M\cdot
N\cdot d_x\cdot d_y}\le
$$
$$
\le\frac{G^{\mathrm{max}}\cdot\left(M+N-1\right)\cdot d_x\cdot
d_y}{G^{\mathrm{good}}\cdot M\cdot N\cdot d_x\cdot d_y}
\le\frac{\left(M+N-1\right)\cdot\beta}{M\cdot N}.
$$


Without loss of generality, let $d_x=d_y$ and $w=\alpha\cdot h$,
then $M=\alpha\cdot N$, and
$$
\delta \le\frac{\left(M+N-1\right)\cdot\beta}{M\cdot N}
\le\frac{\left(\alpha+1\right)\cdot\beta}{\alpha\cdot N} .
$$


Let $\gamma>0$ be an arbitrary constant. If the following
relationship holds, then the relative algorithm error $\delta \le
\gamma$:
$$
d_y\le \frac{h\cdot\alpha\cdot\gamma}{(\alpha+1)\cdot\beta}.
$$

For example, if the rectangle $R$ has $h=1000$ m and $w=500$ m
(i.~e. $\alpha=1/2$), and $\beta=3$, then a cell size of no more
than 5.5 provides a solution with relative error not exceeding
$\gamma=0.05$.


{\bf Conclusion.} The article presents the formulation and
algorithm for solving the problem of maximizing the weighted area
of axis-parallel rectangle covering polygons of arbitrary shapes
and given densities.

The algorithm can find a solution to the problem with a given
accuracy.

The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(n\cdot P\cdot
Q)$. Since the main algorithm goes through all the cells $P \times
Q$, and coordinate-wise descent algorithm take into account edges
and vertices of all polygons.

The task finds its practical application in the area of forest cutting planning.
