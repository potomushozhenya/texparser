{\leftskip=7mm\noindent This article describes an algorithm for
solving the optimal control problem in the case when the
considered process is described by a linear system of ordinary
differential equations. The initial and final states of the system
are fixed and straight two-sided constraints for the control
functions are defined. The purpose of optimization is to minimize
the quadratic functional of control variables. The control is
selected in the class of quadratic splines. There is some
evolution of the method when control is selected in the class of
piecewise constant functions. Conveniently, due to the
addition/removal of constraints in knots, the control function can
be piecewise continuous, continuous, or continuously
differentiable. The solution algorithm consists in reducing the
control problem to a convex mixed-integer
quadratically-constrained programming problem, which could be
solved by using well-known optimization methods that utilize
special software.\\[1mm]

{\bf 1. Introduction.}  Often, in mathematical models describing
various mechanical, electrodynamic, economic, or other processes,
the control function by its nature must be continuous or even
smooth in time. Another example is when smooth movement is an
important goal of the control problem. Thus, in [1] the problem of
control constructing for a wheeled mobile robot is considered.
Such machines are used to transport people with disabilities, so
it is necessary to do this with comfort for passengers.

In such situations, it is convenient to select the control from
the class of quadratic splines, because these functions are quite
easy to research, and they can approximate dif\-ficult nonlinear
functions. Also by adding or removing constraints in knots, the
control\linebreak function can be made piecewise-continuous,
continuous, or smooth. The entire considered time segment is
splitted into some predetermined number of sub-segments $N$ (for
simplicity, we assume that all sub-segments are of the same
length, but this is easy to change). And on each segment, we will
consider a polynomial of the second degree as a control function.

This work is a continuation of the articles [2,\,3], in which
algorithms of constructing optimal control for the linear and
nonlinear cases in the class of piecewise constant func\-tions are
described, which is very justified, given the global
digitalization and, the\-re\-fore, the sampling of most processes.
The original idea in this area belongs to the R.~Ga\-ba\-sov
research team [4]. Related researches are also presented in
[5,\,6].
%%%
%%%    PROBLEM STATEMENT
%%%

%\vspace{0.3cm}

{\bf 2. Problem statement.}  The dynamics of the process is
consistent with a linear system of ordinary differential equations
with control:
\begin{equation}
\label{1}
    \dot x = Ax + Bu,
\end{equation}
where $x(t)$ is a $n$-dimensional phase vector; $\dot x(t)$ is a
derivative of $x(t)$; $u(t)$ is a $r$-di\-mensional control
vector; $A$ is a $(n\times n)$-matrix; $B$ is a $(n\times
m)$-matrix; $t$ is a time variable defined in a segment $[0, ~T]$.

The terminal problem is to transfer the system from the initial to
the final state:
\begin{equation}
\label{2}
    x(0) = x_*, \quad x(T) = x^*.
\end{equation}
The controls have two-sided constraints:
\begin{equation}
\label{3}
    l^{(1)}_i \leq u_i \leq l^{(2)}_i, \quad i = \overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
We also assume that the controls belong to the class of smooth
functions:
\begin{equation}
\label{4} u_i(t) \in C^1\big([0,~T]\big),\quad i \in
\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
The objective of the control is to minimize the integral of the
quadratic form of $u$:
\begin{equation}
\label{5}
    J = \int\limits_0^T u(t)^TQu(t)~ dt \longrightarrow \min.
\end{equation}
In this expression, $Q$ is a $m\times m$ symmetric matrix. Suppose
that $Q$ is a Positive Semi-Definite matrix. This is an optional
restriction. But the convexity of the problem depends on this,
which is very important for solvability.

The control is chosen in the class of uniform quadratic splines
with knots $t_k=Tk/N,~k=\overline{0, N}$, where $N$ is predefined
number:
\begin{equation}
\label{6} u_i(t) = \left\{
\def\arraystretch{1.6}
\begin{array}{l}
    p_{ik}^{(2)}t^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t + p_{ik}^{(0)}, \quad t \in [t_{k-1}, ~t_k),\\
    k = \overline{1, N},
\end{array}
\right. \quad i = \overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Thus the problem is in finding  optimal admissible values of
$p_{ik}^{(0)}, ~p_{ik}^{(1)}, ~p_{ik}^{(2)}.$


%%%
%%%    Reduction to MIQCP problem
%%%


%\vspace{0.3cm}
{\bf 3. Reduction to MIQCP problem.} In this
section it will be shown that the optimal control problem
(\ref{1})--(\ref{6}) can be reduced to an optimization problem
with continuous and binary variables, linear and quadratic
constraints and a quadratic objective function. This problem
termed a Mixed-Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programming
(MIQCP).

%\subsection{Smoothness Conditions}
\textbf{\textit{Smoothness condition.}} Since the control is
represented as a quadratic spline, there are guaranteed smoothness
between knots. Therefore, it remains to ensure continuity and
smoothness at knots.

Continuity at knots for control functions:
\begin{equation}
\label{7} p^{(2)}_{ik}t_k^2 + p^{(1)}_{ik}t_k + p^{(0)}_{ik} =
p^{(2)}_{ik+1}t_k^2 + p^{(1)}_{ik+1}t_k + p^{(0)}_{ik+1}, \quad k
= \overline{1,N-1}, \quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Continuity at knots for derivatives of control functions:
\begin{equation}
\label{8} 2p^{(2)}_{ik}t_k + p^{(1)}_{ik} = 2p^{(2)}_{ik+1}t_k+
p^{(1)}_{ik+1}, \quad k = \overline{1,N-1}, \quad
i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Note, if smoothness is not required at knots, we just need to
disable restrictions (\ref{8}). If continuous is also not
required, we also need to disable restrictions (\ref {7}).

%
%\subsection{Straight Constraints}

\textbf{\textit{Straight constraints.}} In accordance with
inequalities (\ref{3}) and representation of the control functions
as (\ref{6}), the following conditions must be satisfied:
$$
l_i^{(1)} \leq p_{ik}^{(2)}t^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t + p_{ik}^{(0)} \leq
l_i^{(2)}\,\,\, \forall t \in [t_{k-1}, ~t_k), \quad
k=\overline{1,N}, \quad i=\overline{1,r}.
$$
These conditions can be transformed to extremum conditions
$$
\def\arraystretch{1.8}
\begin{array}{l}
l_i^{(1)} \leq \inf\limits_{t \in [t_{k-1}, ~t_k)}\left(p_{ik}^{(2)}t^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t + p_{ik}^{(0)}\right),\\
l_i^{(2)} \geq \sup\limits_{t \in [t_{k-1},
~t_k)}\left(p_{ik}^{(2)}t^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t + p_{ik}^{(0)}\right),
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N}, \quad i=\overline{1,r}.
$$
In this case, on each segment $[t_{k-1}, ~t_k)$, it is necessary
to consider only three points suspicious of extremum: $t_{k-1}$,
$~t_{k}$ and $-p_{ik}^{(1)}/2p_{ik}^{(2)}$.
%В таком случае, на каждом из отрезков $[T(k-1)/N, ~Tk/N]$ необходимо рассмотреть лишь три точки, подозрительные на экстремум: $T(k-1)/N$, $Tk/N$ и $-p_{ik}^{(1)}/2p_{ik}^{(2)}$.

There are simple restrictions for knot points:
\begin{equation}
\label{9}
\def\arraystretch{1.8}
\begin{array}{c}
    l_i^{(1)} \leq p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k-1}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k-1} + p_{ik}^{(0)} \leq l_i^{(2)}, \\
    l_i^{(1)} \leq p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k} + p_{ik}^{(0)} \leq l_i^{(2)},
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}

More difficult situation with the parabola extremum
$-p_{ik}^{(1)}/2p_{ik}^{(2)}$. It would be wrong to say that the
extremum value must satisfy two-sided boundaries, because, after
all, it is permissible to violate the boundaries if the argument
of the extremum is to the left or right of the segment $[t_{k-1},
~t_k)$.

For simplicity reassign some variables:
$$
p := p_{ik}^{(2)}, \quad \tau_1 := t_{k-1}, \quad \tau_2 :=
t_{k},\quad l_1 := l^{(1)}_i, \quad l_2 := l^{(2)}_i.
$$
And suppose that values of quadratic polynomial at knots are
fixed:
$$
y_1 := p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k-1}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k-1} + p_{ik}^{(0)},
\quad y_2 := p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k} + p_{ik}^{(0)}.
$$
Then it is possible to express the values of $p_{ik}^{(1)}$ and
$p_{ik}^{(0)}$ through $p$, $y_1$ and $y_2$:
$$
p_{ik}^{(1)} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{\tau_2-\tau_1} - p(\tau_1+\tau_2),
\quad p_{ik}^{(0)} = p\tau_1\tau_2 -
\frac{y_2-y_1}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\tau_1 + y_1.
$$
Now we can find the conditions that an extremum value of quadratic
polynomial is equal~$l_2$:
$$
\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{\tau_2-\tau_1} - p(\tau_1+\tau_2)\right)^2 -
4p\left(p\tau_1\tau_2 - \frac{y_2-y_1}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\tau_1 +
y_1-l_2\right) = 0.
$$
After transformations we get the quadratic equation of $p$:
$$
\left(t_2-t_1\right)^2p^2 + \left(-2(y_1+y_2) + 4l_2\right)p +
\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\right)^2 = 0,
$$
above is a quadratic equation for unknown variable $p$ that has
two solutions:
$$
p = -\left(\frac{\sqrt{l_2-y_1} \pm
\sqrt{l_2-y_2}}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\right)^2.
$$

Thus, the task was solved: find the parameters of the quadratic
polynomial, when two points are fixed, and the extremum is equal
to a predeterminated value. Analysis of solutions makes it easy to
understand that the solution with a larger absolute value
corresponds to the extremum value located between two fixed
points, and another solution corresponds to the extremum value
located outside these points.

By doing the same for the lower bound, we get a two-sided
constraint for $p$:\begin{equation} \label{10}
-\left(\frac{\sqrt{l_2-y_1} +
\sqrt{l_2-y_2}}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\right)^2 \leq p \leq
\left(\frac{\sqrt{y_1-l_1} +
\sqrt{y_2-l_1}}{\tau_2-\tau_1}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Now let's return to the previous notations and introduce new
variables $s^{(1)}_{ik}$, $s^{(2)}_{ik}$, $s^{(3)}_{ik}$,
$s^{(4)}_{ik}$ and add restrictions for them:
\begin{equation}
\label{11}
\def\arraystretch{1.8}
\begin{array}{l}
s^{(1)}_{ik} = p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k-1}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k-1} + p_{ik}^{(0)} - l^{(1)}_i,\\
s^{(2)}_{ik} = p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k}^2+p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k} + p_{ik}^{(0)} - l^{(1)}_i, \\
s^{(3)}_{ik} = l^{(2)}_i - p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k-1}^2-p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k-1} - p_{ik}^{(0)}, \\
s^{(4)}_{ik} =  l^{(2)}_i -  p_{ik}^{(2)}t_{k}^2-p_{ik}^{(1)}t_{k} - p_{ik}^{(0)},\\
s^{(1)}_{ik} \geq 0, \quad s^{(2)}_{ik} \geq 0, \quad s^{(3)}_{ik}
\geq 0, \quad s^{(4)}_{ik} \geq 0,
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Then rewrite equation (\ref{10}):
\begin{equation}
\label{12}
\def\arraystretch{2.2}
\begin{array}{l}
T^2p^{(2)}_{ik} \leq  N^2\left(s^{(1)}_{ik}+s^{(2)}_{ik} + 2\sqrt{s^{(1)}_{ik}s^{(2)}_{ik}}\right),\\
T^2p^{(2)}_{ik} \geq -N^2\left(s^{(3)}_{ik}+s^{(4)}_{ik}+
2\sqrt{s^{(3)}_{ik}s^{(4)}_{ik}}\right),
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Next step is to split variables $p_{ik}^{(2)}$ to new non-negative
variables $r^{(1)}_{ik}$, $r^{(2)}_{ik}$, $r^{(3)}_{ik}$,
$r^{(4)}_{ik}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{13}
\def\arraystretch{1.8}
\begin{array}{l}
T^2p^{(2)}_{ik} = N^2\left(-r^{(1)}_{ik} - r^{(2)}_{ik} + r^{(3)}_{ik} + r^{(4)}_{ik}\right),\\
r^{(1)}_{ik} \geq 0, \quad r^{(2)}_{ik} \geq 0, \quad r^{(3)}_{ik}
\geq 0, \quad r^{(4)}_{ik} \geq 0,
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
The idea behind this separation is that in equations (\ref{12})
$r^{(1)}_{ik}$ should be responsible for the linear part of the
lower boundary,  $r^{(2)}_{ik}$ should be responsible for the
non-linear part of the lower boundary,  $r^{(3)}_{ik}$ should be
responsible for the linear part of the upper boundary and
$r^{(4)}_{ik}$ should be responsible for the non-linear part of
the upper boundary.

Important detail is that if $p^{(2)}_{ik} > 0$ then $r^{(1)}_{ik}
+ r^{(2)}_{ik} = 0$. Otherwise, if $p^{(2)}_{ik} < 0$ then
$r^{(3)}_{ik} + r^{(4)}_{ik} = 0$. To ensure this, we have to
introduce a binary variable $\delta_{ik}$ and append following
constraints:
\begin{equation}
\label{14}
\def\arraystretch{2}
\begin{array}{l}
r^{(1)}_{ik} + r^{(2)}_{ik} \leq 4\left(l^{(2)}_i - l^{(1)}_i\right)\delta_{ik},\\
r^{(3)}_{ik} + r^{(4)}_{ik} \leq 4\left(l^{(2)}_i -
l^{(1)}_i\right)(1-\delta_{ik}),
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}
Thereby, if $\delta_{ik} = 0$ then $r^{(1)}_{ik} + r^{(2)}_{ik} =
0$, else if $\delta_{ik} = 1$ then $r^{(3)}_{ik} + r^{(4)}_{ik} =
0$. Element $4(l^{(2)}_i - l^{(1)}_i)$ means upper bound because
it is easy to demonstrate that if $p^{(2)}_{ik} > 4(l^{(2)}_i -
l^{(1)}_i)N^2/T^2$ then straight constraints are anyway violated.

Finally, let's rewrite the linear part of constraints (\ref{12})
in the new notations:
\begin{equation}
\label{15} r^{(1)}_{ik} \leq s^{(3)}_{ik} + s^{(4)}_{ik}, \quad
r^{(3)}_{ik} \leq s^{(1)}_{ik} + s^{(2)}_{ik}, \quad
k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r},
\end{equation}
and non-linear part:
\begin{equation}
\label{16}
\begin{array}{l}
\left(r^{(2)}_{ik}\right)^2 \leq 4s^{(3)}_{ik}s^{(4)}_{ik}, \quad
\left(r^{(4)}_{ik}\right)^2 \leq 4s^{(1)}_{ik}s^{(2)}_{ik},
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N},\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
\end{equation}

Note that constraints (\ref{16}) are a rotated Second-Order Cone
constraints. This is main achievement and we will discuss it in
the Section 4.

In summary, it was shown how two-sided constraints (\ref{3}) were
transformed into linear constraints (\ref{9}), (\ref{11}),
(\ref{13}), (\ref{15}), linear inequalities with binary variables
(\ref{14}) and quadratic inequalities (\ref{16}).

%\subsection{Terminal Conditions}

\textbf{\textit{Terminal conditions.}} The condition for the
initial state is already satisfied, since it is a part of the
Cauchy problem. Let us define the conditions for the final state.

Write the Cauchy formula at final point and apply conditions
(\ref{2})
$$
x^* = e^{AT}x_* + \int\limits_0^Te^{A(T-t)}Bu(t)dt.
$$
Let's divide segment $[0, ~T]$ into $N$ subsegments with the same
lengths and apply that the control function is selected in the
form (\ref{6})
\begin{multline*}
x^* = e^{AT}x_* + \\ + \sum_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left[
\left(\int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_it^2dt\right)\!p^{(2)}_{ik}
+\!
\left(\int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_itdt\right)\!p^{(1)}_{ik}
+\!
\left(\int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_idt\right)\!p^{(0)}_{ik}\right]\!.
\end{multline*}
Here $b_i$ denotes the column $i$ of the matrix $B$.

Vector functions $e^{A(T-t)}b_i$ could be numerically calculated
as solutions of the following Cauchy problems (it's profitable if
$r < n$):
$$
\def\arraystretch{1.6}
\begin{array}{l}
\dot z^{(i)} = -Az^{(i)}(t),\\
z^{(i)}(T) = b_i,
\end{array}
\quad i=\overline{1,r}.
$$

Now let's introduce new notations:
$$
g := x^* - e^{AT}x_*,
$$
$$
\def\arraystretch{2}
\begin{array}{l}
d^{i, k, 0} := \int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_idt,\\
d^{i, k, 1} := \int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_itdt,\\
d^{i, k, 2} := \int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}e^{A(T-t)}b_it^2dt,
\end{array}
\quad k=\overline{1,N}, \quad i=\overline{1,r},
$$
it is assumed that integrals will be calculated numerically.

Then we get $n$ linear equalities
\begin{equation}
\label{17}
\sum_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(d^{i,k,0}_jp_{ik}^{(0)} +
d^{i,k,1}_jp_{ik}^{(1)} + d^{i,k,2}_jp_{ik}^{(2)}\right) = g_j,
\quad j=\overline{1,n}.
\end{equation}

%\subsection{Objective Function}
\textbf{\textit{Objective function.}} Replace the control $u(t)$
by quadratic spline (\ref{6}) in the objective function (\ref{5}):
$$
J =
\sum_{k=1}^N\sum_{i_1=1}^r\sum_{i_2=1}^r\int\limits_{t_{k-1}}^{t_{k}}
q_{i_1i_2}\left(p_{i_1k}^{(2)}t^2+p_{i_1k}^{(1)}t +
p_{i_1k}^{(0)}\right)\left(p_{i_2k}^{(2)}t^2+p_{i_2k}^{(1)}t +
p_{i_2k}^{(0)}\right)dt,
$$
where $q_{i_1i_2}$ is an element of the matrix $Q$.

After calculating of the integrals and introducing new
designations, we obtain quadratic form in the variables
$p_{ik}^{(0)}$, $p_{ik}^{(1)}$ and $p_{ik}^{(2)}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{18} J =
\sum_{k=1}^N\sum_{i_1=1}^r\sum_{i_2=1}^r\sum_{\alpha_1=0}^2\sum_{\alpha_2=0}^2
\left(h_{i_1i_2k}^{\alpha_1,\alpha_2} p_{i_1k}^{(\alpha_1)}
p_{i_2k}^{(\alpha_2)}\right),
\end{equation}
here
$$
h_{i_1i_2k}^{\alpha_1,\alpha_2} :=
q_{i_1i_2}\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{T^{\beta}}{N^{\beta}}\left(k^{\beta}-\left(k-1\right)^{\beta}\right),
\quad \beta = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + 1,
$$
$$ k = \overline{1,N}, \quad i_1 = \overline{1,r},\quad i_2 = \overline{1,r},\quad \alpha_1 = \overline{0,2},\quad \alpha_2 = \overline{0,2}.
$$
%Since Q is a positive semi-definite matrix, it can be proved that the quadratic form in the formula (\ref{18}) is a positive semi-definite.
According Q is a positive semi-definite matrix, in 3 steps it can
be proved that the quadratic form in the formula (\ref{18}) is a
positive semi-definite:
%\begin{enumerate}%[wide, label=\arabic*)]

%\item[
1)\,\,%]
the resulting matrix is a block diagonal matrix consisting of $N$
blocks for each $k = \overline{1,N}$. Therefore, it is necessary
to demonstrate that any block is a positive semi-definite matrix;

%\item[
2)%]
\,\,for each $k$ if we fix $t$ then $u_i(t)$ is a linear function
of $p_{ik}^{(0)}$, $p_{ik}^{(1)}$ and $p_{ik}^{(2)}$. Next it can
be shown that composition $G(F(\xi))$ is a positive semi-definite
quadratic form, if $G(\eta)$ is a positive semi-definite quadratic
form and $F(\xi)$ is a linear function. Thence we see that under
the integral  is a positive semi-definite quadratic form in the
variables $p_{ik}^{(0)}$, $p_{ik}^{(1)}$ and $p_{ik}^{(2)}$ for
each fixed $t$;

%\item[
3)%]
\,\,the last step is to show that the result of integrating of a
positive semi-definite quadratic form with the parameter $t$ is a
positive semi-definite quadratic form.
%\end{enumerate}


%\vspace{0.3cm}
{\bf 4. Model analysis.} In previous section the
optimal control problem (\ref{1})--(\ref{6}) was transformed to
the optimization problem (\ref{7})--(\ref{9}), (\ref{11}),
(\ref{13})--(\ref{18}). In this article we are not aimed in
receiving matrix-based model with a minimal number of variables.
Because it is quickly achieved at the stage of presolve in the
runtime of the optimization software. Real purpose is to obtain
effective model, optimal in the terms of calculation time. For
ease of narration, we have described the model in a
constraint-based form. So let's take a closer look at this.

%\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{\textit{Variables}:}
%\begin{enumerate}%[wide, label=\arabic*)]

%\item[
1)\,\,%]
$3rN$ basic continuous variables: $p_{ik}^{(0)}$, $p_{ik}^{(1)}$,
$p_{ik}^{(2)}$, $k=\overline{1,N}$, $i=\overline{1,r}$.

%\item[
2)\,\,%]
$8rN$ continuous non-negative variables: $s_{ik}^{(1)}$,
$s_{ik}^{(2)}$, $s_{ik}^{(3)}$, $s_{ik}^{(4)}$, $r_{ik}^{(1)}$,
$r_{ik}^{(2)}$, $r_{ik}^{(3)}$, $r_{ik}^{(4)}$,
$k=\overline{1,N}$, $i=\overline{1,r}$.

%\item[
3)\,\,%]
$rN$ binary variables: $\delta_{ik}$, $k=\overline{1,N}$,
$i=\overline{1,r}$.
%\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textit{Constraints}:}
%\begin{enumerate}%[wide, label=\arabic*)]

%\item[

$7rN - 2r + n$ linear equalities: (\ref{7}), (\ref{8}),
(\ref{11}), (\ref{13}), (\ref{17}). So a number of variables can
be excluded.

%\item[

$2rN$ quadratic inequalities: (\ref{16}). Although quadratic
constraints are not re\-pre\-sen\-ted by positive semi-definite
quadratic forms, they are rotated Second-Order Cone equations. And
it can be proved that in the case when the variables
$s_{ik}^{(1)}$, $s_{ik}^{(2)}$, $s_{ik}^{(3)}$, $s_{ik}^{(4)}$ are
non-negative, there is a convex set of solutions.
%\end{enumerate}

Accordingly, we have a convex set of solutions in the optimization
problem obtained by linear and quadratic constraints.

\textbf{\textit{Objective.}} The objective function (\ref{18}) of
the optimization problem is a positive semi-definite quadratic
form in the variables $p_{ik}^{(0)}$, $p_{ik}^{(1)}$,
$p_{ik}^{(2)}$, $k=\overline{1,N}$, $i=\overline{1,r}$.

\textbf{\textit{Summary.}} Thereby, we have obtained the
optimization problem with continuous and binary variables, linear
and convex quadratic constraints, and a convex quadratic
objective. According to the generally accepted classification,
this problem is a convex case of MIQCP. There are various software
that can resolve this problem, such as Gurobi, CPLEX, Artelys
Knitro, etc. [7].

{\bf 5. Example.} The problem of the damping of the sleeping
Lagrange top [8] was considered as an illustration of the method:
\begin{equation*}
\def\arraystretch{1.4}
\begin{array}{l}
\ddot \xi + B\dot\eta   - A \xi = u_1,\\
\ddot \eta - B\dot\xi   - A \eta = u_2,
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
here $\xi(t)$ and $\eta(t)$ are denote coordinates of the top end;
$u_1(t)$, $u_2(t)$ are generalized forces; $A$ and $B$ are model
parameters, indicating the physical properties of the object.
Let's put $A = 1$, $B = 3$.\pagebreak

%\end{figure}

The terminal problem is to change object position $(\xi,\dot\xi,
\eta,\dot \eta)$ from $(-10, 5, 6, 8)$ to $(0, 0, 0, 0)$. The
value of $T$ was set to 20, $N$ also equals $20$. All lower bounds
are $-2$, all upper bounds are $2$. And finally, $Q$ is
two-dimensional identity matrix.

MIQCP problem was obtained and then solved using Gurobi. Total
processing time is 1.56 s. The result is illustrated at Figure.

{\bf 6. Conclusion}. Recall that the initial problem is a control
problem with a linear ordinary differential equations (ODE)
system, a quadratic objective functional, fixed initial and final
states and bounded control in the form of quadratic splines. This
problem is a~so\-me alternative or generalization of similar
problem with a control in the form of piece\-wise-constant
function. The optimal control problem has been reduced to the
convex case of MIQCP. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary
to carry out a numerical calculation of ODEs and definite
integrals. The main achievement of current research that the
derived optimization problem is a convex, which means that the
global extremum can be efficiently calculated using special
software.

This study is completed, but further researches may be related to
the consideration of nonlinear ODE systems or consideration of
other control functions instead of quadratic splines. More
specific restrictions to the phase or control variables may also
be considered.
