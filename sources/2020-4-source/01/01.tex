%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\bf{1. Introduction.}} The theory of endogenous economic growth,
proposed by J.~Schum\-pe\-ter~[1], is one of the actively
developing branches of modern economic science~[2--4]. The main
idea of this theory lies in that the economic growth is caused by
two interacting processes: innovations and imitations. In order to
apply the results of this theory to real economic systems, there
were proposed several mathematical models, beginning with
K.~Iwai's evolutionary model~[5, 6], which was developed by
V.~M.~Polterovich and G.~M.~Hen\-kin [7] on the basis of the
Burger’s equation from fluid mechanics. Later on, developing the
results from~[8], they proposed the model of the firm capacity
dynamics~[9]. Let $M_i(t)$ be the integrated firm capacity at the
$i$-th level, $\lambda_i$ is the profit per capacity unit at the
$i$-th level, $\varphi_i(t)$ is the share of the investments of
the firms at the $i$-th level for the creation of the capacities
at the next $(i+1)$-th level, $0 \leqslant \varphi_i(t) \leqslant
1$. Then the capacity dynamics equation is as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{MnEq1}
\dot{M}_i = (1-\varphi_i)\lambda_i M_i + \varphi_{i-1}
\lambda_{i-1} M_{i-1}, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots,
\end{equation}
under the boundary and initial conditions
%$$
\begin{equation}
M_0(t) \equiv 0, \quad M_i(0) \geqslant 0, \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{N}{M_i(0)} > 0, \quad M_i(0) = 0 \quad \text{if } i >
N.
\end{equation}
%$$
In formulas (1), (2) $N$ is the initial number of levels, $F_i(t)
=
\frac{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{i}{M_k}}{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{M_k}}$,
$\varphi_i = \alpha + \beta (1 - F_i(T))$, $\alpha > 0$, $\beta >
0$ are constants.

In~[10] the authors  have shown that $M_i(t) \rightarrow \infty$
as $t \rightarrow \infty$, which is impossible for economic
systems.

In this article, we, developing the approach of V. M. Polterovich
and G.~M.~Henkin, construct the mathematical models of the capital
distribution dynamics over efficiency levels in which the
boundedness of the economic growth is taken into account. For that
purpose the notion of the economic niche volume which is analogous
to the ecological niche volume is introduced. The economic niche
volume is a limit integrated capital value, for which the growth
rate is so low that there is no capital growth. The equilibrium of
the constructed model is found and its global stability is proved.

This article develops the research presented in~[10, 11]. The main
difference between models studied in these papers is the
following. While in~[10, 11] the considered models have distinct
economic niches for efficiency levels, in this paper the unique
shared economic niche for all levels is considered. This
difference implies the essential difficulties while proving the
stability results. Particularly, the equilibrium is not a
hyperbolic point. Besides, the method, by which the global
stability for $n$-dimensional dynamical system was proved in~[10,
11], is unsuitable.

{\bf{2. The model of the capital distribution dynamics over
efficiency levels.}} Let $N$ be the number of efficiency levels.
Assume that the greater $i$ corresponds to the higher level.
Consider the following system of differential equations:
\begin{equation}\label{ShEN}
 \begin{cases}
   \dot{C}_1 = \frac{1-\varphi_1}{\lambda_1} C_1 (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_N) = f_1(C_1, \ldots, C_N), \\
   \dot{C}_i = \frac{1-\varphi_i}{\lambda_i} C_i (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_N) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = f_i(C_1, \ldots, C_N), \quad i = 2,\ldots, N.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, $C_i$ is the integrated capital of all firms at the $i$-th
level (one firm can have the capital at different levels); $V$ is
the economic niche volume, $\varphi_i$ is the share of capital of
the firms at the $i$-th level intended to the developing of the
production at the next, $(i+1)$-th, level; $\lambda_i$ is the unit
prime cost at the $i$-th level (i. e. the unit goods production
cost per unit time), $i=1,\ldots,N$, $V > 0$, $0 < \varphi_i < 1$,
$\lambda_i > 0$ are constants.

As one can see, the right-hand sides of the equations (\ref{ShEN})
of the capital growth rates, except for the first one, contain two
addends: the first addend describes the capital growth due to the
production at the level $i$, the second one --- due to the
investments from the previous level $i-1$. The first addend is
positive, i.~e. the capital increases, if the amount of the
capitals is not greater than the economic niche volume, otherwise,
the first addend is negative, i. e. the production runs down.
However, the investments from the previous level provide the
capital growth during some time, while the value of the positive
second addend is greater than the absolute value of the negative
first addend, i. e. while the investments from the previous,
$(i-1)$-th, level are greater than the firm losses at the $i$-th
level induced by exceeding of the economic niche volume.

Equating the right-hand sides of the equations to zero we obtain
the equilibria: $O = (0, ..., 0)$ and $P = (0, ..., 0, V)$.

{\bf Remark 1.} It is worth to note that the Jacobi matrix at the
point $P$ has all the eigenvalues equal to zero, except one ---
negative, which does not allow to establish the local stability
using linear approximation. The Jacobi matrix is
\begin{equation}\nonumber
f' = \{ f_{ij}\}, \quad i,j = 1, \ldots, N,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\nonumber
f_{ij} = \begin{cases} a_i (V - 2 C_i - \sum\limits_{k \neq i} {C_k}), \quad i = j, \\
-a_i C_i + \varphi_{i-1}, \quad i = j + 1, \\
-a_i C_i, \quad \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Determine the eigenvalues for the equilibria $P=(0,\ldots,V)$ as
the roots of the cha\-rac\-teris\-tic polynomial
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\text{det}f'(0, \ldots 0, V) - \lambda E =
{(-\lambda)}^{N-1}(-a_N V - \lambda) = 0.
\end{equation}
We obtain $\lambda_j = 0$, $j = 1, \ldots, N-1$, $\lambda_N = -a_N
V < 0$.

{\bf Proposition 1.}\label{Pr1Inv} The set $\mathbb{R}^N_+ =
\{(C_1, \ldots, C_N) \in \mathbb{R}^N: C_i \geqslant 0, i = 1,
\ldots, N\}$ is invariant.

{\so {Proof.}} If $C_1 = 0$, then from (\ref{ShEN}) we obtain
$\dot{C}_1 = 0$. It means that the trajectories do not leave
$\mathbb{R}^N_+$ through the boundary hyperplane $C_1 = 0$. If
$C_i = 0$, then from (\ref{ShEN}) we obtain $\dot{C}_i =
\varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} \geqslant 0$. It means that the trajectories
do not leave $\mathbb{R}^N_+$ through the boundary hyperplane $C_i
= 0$. Thus, the trajectories do not leave $\mathbb{R}^N_+$,
therefore, $\mathbb{R}^N_+$ is invariant.

Let us denote $a_i = \frac{1-\varphi_i}{\lambda_i}$.

{\bf Proposition 2.}\label{Pr2Par} All trajectories enter the
parallelepiped $K = \{(C_1, \ldots, C_N) \in \mathbb{R}^N: 0
\leqslant C_1 \leqslant V, ~ 0 \leqslant C_i \leqslant
\text{max}(\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i}, V), ~ i = 2, \ldots, N \}$
and do not leave it.

{\so {Proof.}} If $\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} \geqslant V$, then
for $C_i = \frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i}$:
\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
\dot{C}_i = \varphi_{i-1} (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} -
\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - C_{i+1} \ldots - C_{N}) +
\varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = \\ \nonumber = \varphi_{i-1} (V - C_1 -
\ldots - C_{i-2} - \frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - C_{i+1} - \ldots -
C_{N}) < 0.
\end{eqnarray}

If $\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} \geqslant V$, then for $C_i = R
\geqslant \frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i}:$
\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
\dot{C}_i =  a_i R (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} - R - C_{i+1} -
\ldots - C_{N}) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} \leqslant \\ \nonumber
\leqslant a_i R (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} -
\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - C_{i+1} \ldots - C_{N}) +
\varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} \leqslant \\ \nonumber \leqslant
\varphi_{i-1} (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} -
\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - C_{i+1} \ldots - C_{N}) +
\varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = \\ \nonumber = \varphi_{i-1} (V - C_1 -
\ldots - C_{i-2} - \frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - C_{i+1} - \ldots -
C_{N}) < 0.
\end{eqnarray}

If $\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} < V$, then for $C_i = V$:
\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
\dot{C}_i = a_i V (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} - V - C_{i+1} -
\ldots - C_{N}) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = \\ \nonumber = a_i
C_{i-1} (\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i}- V) + a_i V (-C_1 - \ldots -
C_{i-2} - C_{i+1} - \ldots - C_{N}) < 0.
\end{eqnarray}

If $\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} < V$, then for $C_i = R \geqslant
V$:
\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
\dot{C}_i = a_i R (V - C_1 - \ldots - C_{i-1} - R - C_{i+1} -
\ldots - C_{N}) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = \\ \nonumber = a_i
C_{i-1} (\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i} - V) + a_i R (V - R - C_1 -
\ldots - C_{i-2} - C_{i+1} - \ldots - C_{N}) < 0.
\end{eqnarray}

So, all trajectories enter any parallelepiped $K_R  = \{(C_1,
\ldots, C_N) \in \mathbb{R}^N\!: 0 \leqslant C_1 \leqslant V,$ $0
\leqslant C_i \leqslant R, ~i = 2, \ldots, N \}$, where $R
\geqslant \max(\frac{\varphi_{i-1}}{a_i}, V)$ and do not leave it.
Therefore, all trajectories enter the smallest parallelepiped $K$.

In the rest of the paper we  obtain  results dealing with the
problem of the global stability of the equilibrium $P$. Let us
introduce the following notions and designations. Denote by $C(t,
C^0)\in \mathbb{R}^n_+$ the solution of (\ref{ShEN}) such that
$C(0, C^0)=C^0\in \mathbb{R}^n_+$, $C=(C_1,...,C_n)$,
$C^0=(C_1^0,...,C_n^0)$. Let $\rho(x,y)=||x-y||$ be the Euclidean
metric in $\mathbb{R}^N$.

{\bf Definition.} {\textit{ The equilibrium $P$ of the system
$(\ref{ShEN})$ is globally stable in $\mathbb{R}^n_+\setminus
\{O\}$ if  $C(t, C^0)\rightarrow P$, as $t \rightarrow \infty$,
for every $C^0\in \mathbb{R}^n_+\setminus \{O\}$.}}

The main result of the paper is as follows: the equilibrium
$P=(0,...,0,V)\in \mathbb{R}^n_+$ is globally stable in
$\mathbb{R}^n_+\setminus \{O\}$.

{\textbf{\textit{2.1. Two efficiency levels.}}} Let us consider
the model with two efficiency levels:

\vskip 3mm\begin{equation}\label{ShEN2}
 \begin{cases}
   \dot{C}_1 = \frac{1-\varphi_1}{\lambda_1} C_1 (V - C_1 - C_2) = f_1(C_1, C_2), \\
   \dot{C}_2 = \frac{1-\varphi_2}{\lambda_2} C_2 (V - C_1 - C_2) + \varphi_{1} C_{1} = f_i(C_1, C_2).
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\vskip 3mm{\bf Theorem 1.}\label{Th1_2L} {\textit{The equilibrium
$P = (0, V)$ of the system $(\ref{ShEN2})$ is globally stable in
$\mathbb{R}^2_+ \smallsetminus \{O\}$.}}


{\so {Proof.}} The interior of the set $\mathbb{R}^2_+
\smallsetminus \{O\}$ is divided by the $\dot{C}_1 = 0$ isocline:
$C_1 + C_2 = V$ and $\dot{C}_2 = 0$ isocline: $C_2 = \tilde{C_2}$,
where $\tilde{C_2} = \frac{V - C_1 + \sqrt{{(V - C_1)}^2 + \frac{4
\varphi_1 C_1}{a_2}}}{2}$, into 3 domains $D_i$ as follows
(Figure):

\begin{itemize}
\item $D_1 = \{(C_1,C_2):  C_1 + C_2 < V\}$, in which $f_1 > 0, f_2 > 0$;
\item $D_2 = \{(C_1,C_2):  C_1 + C_2 > V, C_2 < \tilde{C_2}\}$, in which $f_1 < 0, f_2 > 0$;
\item $D_3 = \{(C_1,C_2):  C_1 + C_2 > V, C_2 > \tilde{C_2}\}$, in which $f_1 < 0, f_2 < 0$.
\end{itemize}


To prove the global stability of the equilibrium $P = (0,V)$ we
construct the family of nested sets $\{E(d), d>0 \}$ containing
$P$, diameters of which tend to $0$ as $d\rightarrow 0$, such that
all trajectories enter and do not leave each of these sets. Taking
into account Pro\-po\-si\-tion~2, consider trajectories $C(t,C^0)
= (C_1(t),C_2(t))$, where $C(0,C^0) = C^0$, for which $C^0 \in K
\setminus \{O \}$. Since $\dot{C}_1(t) + \dot{C}_2(t) > 0$, if $0
< C_1(t) + C_2(t) < V$, then all trajectories leave the triangle
$\{(C_1, C_2): 0 < C_1 + C_2 \leqslant V \}$. Consider the family
of sets:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
E(d) = \{(C_1, C_2): V \leqslant C_1 + C_2 \leqslant d +
\tilde{C_2}(d), 0 \leqslant C_1 \leqslant d, C_2 \geqslant 0 \}.
\end{equation}
Obviously, $E(d_2) \subset E(d_1)$, if $d_2 < d_1$, and $(0,V) \in
E(d)$ for any $d \geqslant 0$ (see Figure).



All trajectories enter $E(d)$ for $d > 0$. Really, trajectories
intersect any straight line $C_1 = d$ from right to left (so that
$C_1$ is decreasing) for $C_1 + C_2 > V$. As shown above, the
straight line $C_1 + C_2 = V$ is intersected by trajectories from
below to upward. Clearly, the inner product of the vector $\bar{f}
= (f_1,f_2)$ and the normal vector $\bar{n} = (-1,-1)$ to any
straight line $C_1 + C_2 = d + \tilde{C_2}(d)$ is positive,
$(\bar{f}, \bar{n}) > 0$, for all points belonging to a straight
line $C_1 + C_2 = d + \tilde{C_2}(d)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2_+$. Hence,
trajectories intersect any straight line $C_1 + C_2 = d +
\tilde{C_2}(d)$ so that $C_1, C_2$ are decreasing.

Therefore, all trajectories enter each $E(d)$. Taking into account
that $d$ may be arbitrary small, we obtain the result: $C(t,C^0)
\rightarrow P = (0,V)$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.

{\bf Remark 2.} We notice that the location of the asymptote $C_2
= \frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$ with respect to the line $C_2 = V$ and,
hence, the form of the isocline $C_2 = \tilde{C_2}$, depends on
whether $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$ is greater or less than $V$. Let
us give an economic interpretation of the cases
$\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} < V$ and $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} \geqslant
V$. In the case $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} < V$ the asymptote $C_2 =
\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$ of the isocline $C_1 = \tilde{C_1}$ is
lower than $V$. From economic point of view it can be explained as
follows: if $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} < V$, then the contribution of
the investments from the first level to the capital growth at the
second level is much less than the contribution of the production
at the second level. As a result these investments from the first
level provide small capital growth at the second level when the
production at this level runs down. If $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}
\geqslant V$, then the contribution of the investments from the
first level to the capital growth at the second level is
significant in comparison with the contribution of the production
at the second level. Thus, these investments provide greater
capital growth at the second level when the production at this
level runs down. It is clear that the first case,
$\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} < V$, is typical while the latter case,
$\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} \geqslant V$, indicates at some problems in
economy.

Now,  we show the existence of  a separatrix in the domain $D_2$,
if $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} < V$, or in the domain $D_3$, if
$\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} > V$. Let us prove the existence of  a
separatrix in the former case (the proof of the latter case is
analogous). Consider the set $\Omega$ bounded by two curves, $L^+$
and $L^-$. The upper boundary $L^+$ is the $\dot{C}_2=0$ isocline,
$C_2 = \tilde{C}_2$. The lower boundary $L^-$ is the union of the
asymptote $C_2 = \frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$ of the curve $C_2 =
\tilde{C}_2$ with $C_1 > V-\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$ and the segment
of the straight line $C_1+C_2=V$ with $C_1 \in
[V-\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}, V]$, $C_2 \in [\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2},
V]$. Let us call the sets of trajectories entering $\Omega$
through $L^+$ and  $L^-$ the upper and below flows, respectively.
It is obvious that $\Omega$ is invariant set. Below we show that
there exists a unique trajectory in $\Omega$  which does not
intersects  $L^+$ or  $L^-$. We call this trajectory a separatrix.
We may say that the separatrix separates the upper and below
flows.

{\bf Theorem 2.}\label{Th2_2L} {\textit{There exists a unique
separatrix  in $\Omega$.}}

{\so {Proof.}} Denote by $[AB]$ a segment, perpendicular to the
axis $C_1$, such that $A \in L^+$, $B \in L^-$. Denote by $C_1(A)$
the $C_1$ coordinate of point $A$, where $C_1(A)=C_1(B)$. Denote
$[A, \infty) = \{(C_1,C_2)\in L^+:  C_1 \geqslant C_1(A)\}$, $[B,
\infty) = \{(C_1,C_2)\in L^-:  C_1 \geqslant C_1(B)\}$. For every
point  $M \in [A, \infty)$ the inequality $\dot{C}_1<0$ implies
that the trajectory $C(t, M)$ intersects $[AB]$ at some point
$M_1\in [AB]$. Thus, we obtain a homeomorphic map from $[A,
\infty)$ onto some interval $[A, A_1)\subset [AB]$. Similarly,  we
obtain a homeomorphic map from $[B, \infty)$ onto  $[B,
B_1)\subset [AB]$. Note that $A_1 \neq B_1$ and $[A, A_1) \cap [B,
B_1)=\emptyset$. Hence, in $\Omega$ there exist trajectories
intersecting $[A_1, B_1]$. Usually the set of these trajectories
is called a separatrix  fan.

Let us prove the uniqueness of the separatrix. We prove this fact
by contradiction using the arguments from~[12]. Since $\dot{C}_1 <
0$ in $\Omega$ then we can represent the trajectories in $\Omega$
by the graphics, i. e. as functions of $C_1$. Assume, there are at
least two separatrices, $C_2 = h_1(C_1)$ and $C_2 = h_2(C_1) =
h_1(C_1) + \varepsilon (C_1)$, where $\varepsilon (C_1)
> 0$, $\varepsilon (C_1) \rightarrow 0$ for $C_1 \rightarrow
\infty$,

$$
\frac{d C_2}{d C_1} = \frac{a_2 C_2 (V - C_1 - C_2) + \varphi_1
C_1}{a_1 C_1 (V - C_1 - C_2)} = G(C_1, C_2).
$$

Clearly, $\varepsilon (C_1) = h_2(C_1) - h_1(C_1)$:

$$
\frac{d \varepsilon}{d C_1} = G(C_1, h_2(C_1)) - G(C_1, h_1(C_1))
= $$

$$=\,\frac{d G(C_1, h(C_1))}{d C_2} (h_2(C_1) - h_1(C_1)) = \frac{d
G(C_1, h(C_1))}{d C_2} \varepsilon,
$$
where $h(C_1) \in (h_1(C_1), h_2(C_1)),$

$$
\frac{d G(C_1, C_2)}{d C_2} = \frac {a_1 a_2 C_1 {(V - C_1 -
C_2)}^2 + \varphi_1 a_1 C^2_1}{{(a_1 C_1 (V - C_1 - C_2))}^2} > 0
\text{ for any } C_1, C_2.
$$

We have $\frac{d \varepsilon}{d C_1} = \frac{d G(C_1, h(C_1))}{d
C_2} \varepsilon (C_1) > 0$. Therefore, $\varepsilon (C_1)$
increases for $C_1 \rightarrow \infty$. But $\varepsilon (C_1)
\rightarrow 0$ for $C_1 \rightarrow \infty$. We have reached a
contradiction. Thus, there exists the unique separatrix.

In the case $\frac{\varphi_1}{a_2} = V$ the $\dot{C}_2$ isocline
$C_2 = \tilde{C}_2$, being the straight line, coincides with its
asymptote $C_2 = \frac{\varphi_1}{a_2}$.

{\textit{\textbf{2.2. $N$ efficiency levels.}}} Consider now the
general case of $N$ efficiency levels. This case is described by
the system (\ref{ShEN})
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 \begin{cases}
   \dot{C}_1 = \frac{1-\varphi_1}{\lambda_1} C_1 (V - C_1 - ... - C_N) = f_1(C_1, ..., C_N), \\
   \dot{C}_i = \frac{1-\varphi_i}{\lambda_i} C_i (V - C_1 - ... - C_N) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = f_i(C_1, ..., C_N), \quad i = 2,\ldots,
   N.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}

{\bf Theorem 3.}\label{Th4_NL} {\textit{The equilibrium $P = (0,
..., 0, V)$ of the system $(\ref{ShEN})$ is globally stable in
$\mathbb{R}^N_+ \setminus \{O\}$.}}

{\so {Proof.}} We use the method of mathematical induction with
respect to $N$ --- the dimension of system (\ref{ShEN}). For $N=2$
the desired result is given by Theorem 1.

Denote by $S_N$ the system of the form (\ref{ShEN}) in
$\mathbb{R}^{N}_+$ and by $P_{N} = (0, \ldots, 0, V)\in
\mathbb{R}^{N}_+$ the equilibrium of $S_{N}$. Assume that
$P_{N-1}$ is globally stable equilibrium of the system $S_{N-1} $
in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+ \smallsetminus \{O\}$. Let us prove that
$P_{N}$ is globally stable equilibrium of $S_{N} $ in
$\mathbb{R}^N_+ \smallsetminus \{O\}$.

Consider the system $S_N$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+$. According to
Proposition 2 all trajectories enter the parallelepiped $K$ and do
not leave it. Therefore, all trajectories are positively Lagrange
stable. Hence, the $\omega$-limit set $\Omega_C \neq \varnothing$
for any trajectory $C(t, C^0) \in \mathbb{R}^N_+$~[13].

Consider the set $J(d) = \{(C_1, \ldots, C_N) \in \mathbb{R}^N_+:
0 \leqslant C_1 + \ldots + C_N \leqslant d, d \in [0, V] \}$, and
the trajectory $\tilde{C}(t, C^0)$  belonging to $J(V)\cap
\{(C_1,...,C_N): C_j=0, j=1,...,N-1\}$, i.~e. $\tilde{C}(t, C^0)$
is the trajectory belonging to the  interval $I_N=\{(C_1,...,C_N):
C_j=0, j=1,...,N-1, C_N\in (O, V)\}$ of the $C_N$ axis.

Denote $g(t) = C_1(t) + \ldots + C_N(t)$, where
$(C_1(t),...,C_N(t))=C(t, C^0)$. Then $\dot{g}(t) > 0$ for $C(t,
C^0)\in J(V)\setminus \{O\}$. Hence, all trajectories, except for
$\tilde{C}(t, C^0)$ and $C(t, O)=O$,  leave the  set $J(V)$. As
for $\tilde{C}(t, C^0)$, it is easily to understand that
$\tilde{C}(t, C^0)\rightarrow P$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$, where
$C^0\in I_N$.

Denote  $L = K \smallsetminus J(V)$. Obviously, all trajectories,
except for  $\tilde{C}(t, C^0)$ and $C(t, O)=O$, enter $L$ and do
not leave it. Therefore, if  $C^0\in \mathbb{R}^N_+$, then
$C_1(t)\rightarrow 0$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$ for any trajectory.
Hence, $C_1 = 0$ for any point belonging to $\Omega_{C}$, or
$\Omega_{C} \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1} = \{(C_1, \ldots, C_N) \in
\mathbb{R}^N: C_1 = 0 \}$. Let us show that $\Omega_C = P= (0,
..., 0, V)\in \mathbb{R}^N_+$ for any trajectory $C(t, C^0) \in
\mathbb{R}^N_+\setminus \{O\}$. Assume, on the contrary, that
there exists a trajectory $C(t,C^0)$, $C^0\in
\mathbb{R}^N_+\setminus \{O\}$ for which there exists an
$\omega$-limit point $Q \in \Omega_{C} \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+$
and $Q \neq P$.

Since $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ is the invariant set of (\ref{ShEN}),
then (\ref{ShEN}) in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{s_n-1}
 \begin{cases}
   \dot{C}_2 = \frac{1-\varphi_2}{\lambda_2} C_2 (V - C_2 - ... - C_N) = f_2(C_2, ..., C_N),
   \\[0.2cm]
   \dot{C}_i = \frac{1-\varphi_i}{\lambda_i} C_i (V - C_2 - ... - C_N) + \varphi_{i-1} C_{i-1} = f_i(C_2,\ldots, C_N), \\[0.2cm]
    i = 3,\ldots, N.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Thus, we can assume that the system $S_{N-1}$ has the form
(\ref{s_n-1}). From the induction assumption the equilibrium
$P_{N-1} = (0, ..., 0, V) \in \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ of this system is
globally stable in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+ \setminus \{O\}$.

Consider the trajectory $C(t - t_Q,Q) \in \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$, where
$C(0,Q) = Q$. Consider a point $A$ of the intersection of the
trajectory $C(t - t_Q, Q)$ with the boundary of the set $L$. Let
us show that this point exists. Consider in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+$
the set $L^{N-1} = L \cap \{(C_1, \ldots, C_N): C_1 = 0 \}$ and
the system $\dot{C} = -f(C)$. Obviously, the boundary $\partial
L^{N-1} = \partial L \cap \{(C_1, \ldots, C_N)$:\linebreak $ C_1 =
0 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+$ and in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+$
boundaries of $L$ and $L^{N-1}$ coincide. Since $\dot{C}_2 = -a_2
C_2 (V - $\linebreak $ C_2 - ... - C_N) > 0$, then the trajectory
$C(t-t_Q,Q)$ intersects any hyperplane $\{(C_1, \ldots, C_N): C_2
= \text{const} > 0 \}$ so that $C_2$ is increasing. Therefore,
this trajectory exits $L^{N-1}$ through $\partial L^{N-1}$ and
there exists the point $A = \partial L^{N-1} \cap \{C(t-t_Q,Q) \}
=
\partial L \cap \{C(t-t_Q,Q) \}$. Denote by $\tilde{Q}$ the point
such that $C(\tilde{t}-t_Q,Q) = \tilde{Q}$ (i. e. the
ti-\linebreak me of movement along the trajectory $C(t-t_Q,Q)$
from $Q$ to $\tilde{Q}$ equals $\tilde{t}$). Denote by $U(A),
U(\tilde{Q}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ some neighborhoods of the
points $A$ and $\tilde{Q}$. Let $\pi(A), \pi(\tilde{Q})$ be
hy\-perplanes transversal to the trajectory $C(t-t_Q,Q)$ at the
points $A$, $\tilde{Q}$ respectively. Con\-sider the sets
$U_{\pi}(A) = U(A) \cap \pi(A)$, $U_{\pi}(\tilde{Q}) =
U(\tilde{Q}) \cap \pi(\tilde{Q})$. Though $U_{\pi}(A),
U_{\pi}(\tilde{Q}) \not\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}_+$, but because of
invariance of $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}_+$ the trajectories, intersecting
the sets $U^+_{\pi}(A) = U_{\pi}(A) \cap \mathbb{R}^{N}_+$,
$U^+_{\pi}(\tilde{Q}) = U_{\pi}(\tilde{Q}) \cap \mathbb{R}^{N}_+$,
belong to $\mathbb{R}^{N}_+$. From the Theorem (17.4) in~[12]
there exists a closed trajectory cylinder $Z \subset
\mathbb{R}^{N}_+$ with the trajectory $C(t-t_Q,Q)$ as its axis and
$U^+_{\pi}(A)$, $U^+_{\pi}(\tilde{Q})$ as its bases. By
construction, $Z \subset L$. Since $Q$ is $\omega$-limit point for
$C(t,C_0)$, then this trajectory has to enter the cylinder $Z
\subset L$ infinite number of times. The entrance to the cylinder
$Z$ occurs through $U^+_{\pi}(A)$ from $\mathbb{R}^{N} \setminus
L$. Thus, the trajectory $C(t_0,C^0)$ has to leave $L$ before
entering the cylinder $Z$. But the trajectories cannot leave $L$.
We have reached a contradiction. Thus, $Q$ is not a $\omega$-limit
point of this trajectory. Thus we have, $\Omega_{C} = \{ P_{N} =
(0, ..., 0, V) \}$ for any trajectory $C(t)$. Since any trajectory
$C(t)$ is positively Lagrange stable then, according to the
Theorem (3.07) in~[13], $\rho(C(t), \Omega_{C} = P_{N})
\rightarrow 0$ for $t \rightarrow \infty$ for any $C(t)$. Thus,
$P_{N} = (0, ..., 0, V)$ is global stable in $\mathbb{R}^N_+
\setminus \{O\}$.\pagebreak

\textbf{5. Conclusion.} In this article, the mathematical models
of sector capital distribution dynamics over efficiency levels
with shared economic niche are proposed. The authors develop the
approach of Polterovich---Henkin by taking into account the
boundedness of the economic growth. The models give an opportunity
for the prediction of the behavior of the economic system
dynamics. The qualitative analysis of these models is presented.
The equilibria of the constructed dynamical models are determined,
their global stability is proved. The global stability of the
equilibrium $P=(0,\ldots,0,V)$ means that the capital at the
highest level approaches the value of the economic niche volume,
while the capitals at other levels tend to zero. Thus, the highest
level beats the competition in the case of shared economic niche.
It is worth to note that global stability of the equilibrium means
the economic stagnation. This situation is extremely unfavorable
and, thus, the further economic growth requires structural
variations of the economic system. This is the problem for further
research.
