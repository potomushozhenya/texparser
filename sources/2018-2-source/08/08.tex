{\leftskip=7mm\noindent The comprehensive analysis of structure
and properties was performed for the blood and blood vessels. This
analysis shows that the blood may be considered as a liquid only
in large and middle vessels, where a diameter of vessel is much
more than a dimension of blood cells and their aggregates. In
addition, taking into account the influence of complex internal
structure on its mechanical properties, it is necessary to
consider it as a non-Newtonian liquid. In this regard, the
non-Newtonian liquid with the power connection of the stress
tensor with the strain velocity tensor was chosen for mathematical
modelling of liquid. The pulsating flow is created by the
pulsating nature of the boundary condition for the blood flow at
the input cross-section. The vessels are considered as
thick-walled cylinders with hyperelastic walls. The interaction
between blood and vessel wall is defined by means of semi-slip
boundary condition. Computer simulation was performed in software
complex ANSYS with the use of the direct conjugating module CFX
and the module ANSYS ``Multiphysics''. As a result, the pressure
and stress wave propagation on the vessel wall was obtained.\\[1mm]

\textbf{Introduction.} One of the main difficulties, arising in
computer simulation of haemodynamics, lies in an account of the
complicated blood structure and mechanical properties. As is
known, the blood consists of liquid plasma and deformable blood
cells, which comprise up to 46\% of the blood volume (Fig.~1), and
their mechanical properties and inner structures are poorly
studied.

The main part of blood cells (about 90\%) comprises erythrocytes.
In blood flow they can create aggregates of column form, which
also changes the flow pattern and its mechanical properties [1]
(Fig.~2).

In essence, the blood is a suspension, having complicated and
varied structure. In connection with this the consideration of
blood as a two-phase medium contains significant simplifications
[2, 3]. By this reason, first of all, the blood may be considered
as a liquid only if the blood vessel diameter is much greater than
dimensions of cells and their aggregates. Furthermore, since the
presence of blood cells significantly influences its rheology and,
as a consequence, affects the nature of the flow [4], blood may be
considered only as non-Newtonian liquid that, in its turn, affects
the nature of the flow [4]. The special attention was paid to this
effect in [5]. It is also important to take into account the
non-Newtonian blood properties in cases of vessel pathologies [6].
Effects of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on flow in
diseased arterial vessels even for steady flows was underlined in
[7].

Besides, due attention should be given to the pulse nature of
blood flow in arteries, as it is shown in Fig.~3, which was
obtained during the medical investigation of a patient.

But as the vessel is further and further from the heart the pulse
wave grows weaker and changes its form. This circumstance should
be taken into account when using this characteristic as the
boundary condition.

Another difficulty is the complicated vessel structure and
insufficient knowledge of vessel mechanical properties, which are
essential for their modelling and the and the subsequent
hydroelastic setting of the ``fluid-structure'' problem. As a
result, the authors are usually forced to use only simplified
models.

In this connection it must be emphasized that this blood vessel
property manifests in various degrees for different vessels.

Since the aorta is the most rigid vessel, its wall can be
considered as undeformable [8--11]. However, the vessels which are
located further from heart have deformable walls, and this should
be taken into consideration (see, for example, [12]).

Of great importance is the interaction between the blood and the
vessel wall. It should be noted that the ``no-slip'' condition,
which is usually used as the boundary condition when solving
problems of viscous liquid flow, is unacceptable for the adequate
description of interaction between the blood and the vessel wall
[13]. The matter is that the blood cells do not stick to a healthy
vessel wall and slide along it due to their electrochemical
properties. In this connection it would be appropriate to use the
so-called ``semi-slip'' condition. The expediency of this
condition application for smooth surfaces was pointed out in [14].

\textbf{Mathematical model of blood.}
%
The blood was considered as a non-Newtonian liquid with Power law
for correlation between the stress tensor and the strain velocity
tensor, which can be written in the tensor form
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{T} = 2k|I_{2}|^{\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)}
\boldsymbol{D},
  \label{eq:o1}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{T}$ is the viscous stress tensor,
$\boldsymbol{D}$ is the strain velocity tensor and $I_{2}$ is its
second principal invariant of $\boldsymbol{D}$. Having the
expression of this power law the system of governing equations for
the blood flow can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \rho \frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}=\nabla (-p\boldsymbol{I}+\boldsymbol{T}),
\label{eq:o2}
\end{equation}
here $\boldsymbol{v}$ is the velocity vector and $\boldsymbol{I}$
is the identity tensor. In addition to this, the equation of
continuity should be written
\begin{equation}
 {\rm div} \boldsymbol{v}=0.
\label{eq:o3}
\end{equation}
The rest state was chosen as the initial condition for the
equations (\ref{eq:o1}) and (\ref{eq:o2}) with relationship
(\ref{eq:o3}), that is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:o4} \boldsymbol{v}|_{t=0} = 0.
\end{equation}
After the calculation process starts, it continues until reaching
a steady state regime.

The boundary conditions were set in the following manner. At the
input cross-section of the considered vessel part the pulsating
blood flow was given as it is shown in Fig.~2. The output
cross-section is mentally placed so far that the velocity could be
considered constant and would have only a longitudinal component
$v$. The pressure is also constant, that is
\begin{equation*}
v|_\text{output} = \text{const},\hspace{1ex} p|_\text{output} =
\text{const}.
\end{equation*}

Since, while moving through the vessel the blood cells do not
adhere to the vessel wall, the no-slip condition, which is usually
used for viscous liquid flows through pipes, is unacceptable for
blood flow through the vessels. Because of this, the so called
semi-slip condition was suggested to use. In this case the
longitudinal component of velocity decreases to a certain
preassigned value $v_{0}$ (Fig.~4), which is the boundary
condition at the wall:
\begin{equation*}
v(r_{0},\phi,t)=v_{0}.
\end{equation*}
The degree of semi-slip is usually defined by the parameter $b$.

%\caption{The velocity profile of blood flow between vessel axis
%and vessel wall in the case of semi-slip condition} \label{fig:4}
%\end{figure}

\textbf{Mathematical model of blood vessel.} Blood vessels are
considered as the thick-walled cylinders. The wall material is
hyperelastic orthotropic and incompressible. In this case the
wall's mechanical properties are described by the specific
deformation energy $W$. The equations of the vessel wall motion
can be written in the form
%\begin{eqsys}
\begin{equation*}%
\begin{array}{l}
& \rho \dfrac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla (\boldsymbol{F}(u)\boldsymbol{S}(u)) = 0, \\[-0.3cm]
& \det \boldsymbol{F}(u) = 1,\\[-0.3cm]
& \boldsymbol{E} = \dfrac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{F}^{T}\boldsymbol{F} - \boldsymbol{I}, \\[-0.3cm]
& \boldsymbol{S} = \dfrac{\partial W(\boldsymbol{E})}{\partial
 \boldsymbol{E}},\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
%\end{eqsys}
where \boldsymbol{u} is the wall displacement vector; $\rho$ is
the density of the wall material; \boldsymbol{F} is the
deformation gradient; \boldsymbol{S} is the second
Piola---Kirchhoff stress tensor; \boldsymbol{E} is the Green
strain tensor. The boundary conditions which connect the movements
of the blood and wall with regard to semi-slip condition are as
follows:

\begin{equation*}%
\begin{array}{l}
%\begin{eqsys}
& v|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} = -b \left( \dfrac{\partial
u}{\partial t}\right)|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{n}, \\[-0.3cm] &
v|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} = \left( \dfrac{\partial
u}{\partial t}\right)|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}, \\[-0.3cm]
& \sigma|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} = -(F(u)S(u))|_{wall} \cdot
\boldsymbol{n}, \\[-0.3cm]
& \sigma|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} = -(F(u)S(u))|_{wall} \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}, \\
%\end{eqsys}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
here \boldsymbol{n} and $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ are the normal and
tangent vectors of boundary, and $v$ and $\sigma$  are the blood
velocity and stress on the wall. The stress normal component at
the external wall boundary was taken equal zero.

\textbf{Calculations.} Calculations were performed in software
complex ANSYS with the use of direct conjugating program modul
CFX, destined for the liquid flow simulation, and the module ANSYS
``Multiphysics'', destined for simulation of the stress-strain
state. For this purpose, the three space models of blood vessels
were constructed with the help of computer program CAD and then
were passed into ANSYS ICEM CFD for the construction of the
three-space hexagonal deformable mesh with concentration near the
wall. Exchange of the information between modules CFX and
``Multiphysics'' takes place at each time step, as it is shown in
Fig.~5.

\textbf{Results.} As a result, the pressure wave propagation in
the vessel and stress wave propagation in vessel wall together
with the vessel strain during the pulse wave passage were
obtained. The examples are shown in Figs~6 and 7.

\textbf{Discussion.} Thus, the model of pulsating flow in the
artery with deformable wall was developed. Two principal positions
were used as a basis for computer simulation: the mechanical
models of blood and blood vessel. The blood was considered as
non-Newtonian liquid with Power law for correlation between the
stress tensor the strain velocity tensor. This law contains two
parameters $n$ and $k$, which are usually consider as constant. In
fact, they can vary along the stream and cross-section, but the
nature of this change has not been adequately studied. There are
reasons to assume that these constants depend on hematocrit [15],
but there are only assumptions of specific kind of this
dependence.

It is necessary to point out impossibility to develop the vessel
mechanical model considering the inner structure of its wall. By
this reason, the authors are forced to use averaged properties and
consider the wall material as hyperelastic orthotropic and
incompressible, although this variant is not unique.

In general, it is necessary to ascertain that the main obstacle on
the way of computer simulation of medico-biological objects and
processes is not absence of mathematical instrument and computer
technologies but deficiency of physiological knowledge and
specific data, which are required for construction the more
adequate models.
