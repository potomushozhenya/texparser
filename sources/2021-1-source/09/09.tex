{\bf 1. Introduction.}  Engineering of nanopatterned bimaterial
interfaces is becoming a key technology in the field of electronic
packaging. In many applications, such material design improves
mechanical, optical and electronic properties of products.


However, the interface relief may change during the manufacture
and further processing operations. This can negatively affect the
properties of products and even lead to their destruction due to a
change of stress state near the interface. Therefore, in order to
fabricate structures with the required geometric parameters, as
well as to ensure the stability of the formed relief, it is
necessary to investigate the mechanism of material redistribution
along the interface.



One of the most common models of morphological instability is the
Asaro---Tiller---Grinfeld (ATG) model [1,\,2], in which the
instability of a flat surface is caused by surface diffusion
driven by a change in the chemical potential along the surface. In
this case, the critical wavelength of the perturbated surface,
which corresponds to the steady relief, is directly proportional
to the ratio of the surface energy to the elastic energy of
deformation calculated at the curved surface. The ATG model of
morphological instability was applied in many areas: the
researchers analyzed the morphological evolution of voids,
microchannels, cylindrical fibers and spherical particles embedded
in matrix, core-shell nanowires, mono- and multilayered thin films
[3--5].

The primary interest of the presented study is the development of
theoretical model of diffusional interface growth and pattern
formation in two-phase material taking into account the interface
elasticity.  Within the Gurtin---Murdoch theory of
surface/interface elasticity, the interphase between two materials
is considered as a negligibly thin layer with the elastic
properties which are different from those of the bulk materials
[6, 7]. The rate of the growth of interface roughness depends on
the variation of the chemical potential at the curved interface,
which is a function of interface and bulk stresses. The stress
distribution along the interface is found from the solution of
plane elasticity problem taking into account plane strain
conditions. After that, the linearized evolution equation is
derived, which describes the amplitude change of interface
perturbation with time. A parametric analysis of the obtained
equation leads to the definition of critical conditions which
predict the interface morphological instability and depend on
initial undulation wavelength, thermodynamic parameters, lattice
mismatch stresses, interface tension, surface and bulk elastic
constants.


{\bf 2. Problem formulation.} Consider an isotropic bimaterial
system with undulated interface profile in the field of misfit
stress, which occur due to the lattice mismatch at the interface
between two materials (Fig.~1). It is assumed that the interface
shape changes with time $\tau$ via diffusive mass transport that
leads to misfit stress relaxation. The elastic deformation caused
by interface evolution is treated as a quasi-static state. Taking
into account the plane strain conditions, a two-dimensional
boundary value problem for the infinite plane $B_1\cup B_2$  is
formulated in the terms of complex variable $z=x_{1}+ix_{2}$,
where $i^{2}=-1$ and $(x_{1},x_{2})$ are the global Cartesian
coordinates. According to Gurtin---Murdoch model of
surface/interface elasticity [6, 7], the interface domain is
assumed to be a negligibly thin layer $S$ adhering to the bulk
phases $B_1$ and $B_2$ and with elastic properties which differ
from those of the bulk materials:
\begin{equation}
\label{model}%1
\begin{array}{c}
B_1 = \left\{z:\,x_{2}> \varepsilon(\tau) f(x_1)\right\},\quad  B_2 = \left\{z:\,x_{2}< \varepsilon(\tau) f(x_1)\right\},
\\ \\
S = \left\{ z:\,\,z \equiv \zeta = x_1 + i \varepsilon(\tau) f(x_1) \right\}, \quad  f(x_1)=a\cos{(bx_1)},
\end{array}
\end{equation}
here $\varepsilon(\tau)=A(\tau)/a$, $A(\tau)$ is an amplitude of surface perturbation at the time $\tau$,  $a$ is the initial perturbation wavelength and $b=2\pi/a$ is a wavenumber. As we focus on the linear stability analysis in this paper, it is assumed that $\varepsilon(\tau)\ll1\,\,\,  \forall \,\tau >0$.


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{
\includegraphics[scale=1]{09/fig1}

\vskip 2mm {\small{\it Fig. 1.} A model of a bimaterial with
slightly perturbated interface\\ under the uniaxial tension} }
\end{figure}


The constitutive equations of Gurtin---Murdoch model are used in the assumption that the normal component of the surface gradient tensor in the constitutive equation is neglected:
\begin{equation}
\label{surf-elast}%2
\sigma_{tt}^s(\zeta)=\gamma_{0}+M_{s}\varepsilon_{tt}^{s}(\zeta),\quad \sigma_{33}^{s}(\zeta)=\gamma_{0}+(\lambda_{s}+\gamma_{0})
\varepsilon_{tt}^{s}(\zeta),\quad \zeta \in S,
\end{equation}
where  $\varepsilon_{tt}^{s}$ and $\sigma_{tt}^{s}$ are the
nonvanishing components of the interface strain and the
Piola---Kirchhoff surface/interface stress tensor, respectively;
$M_{s}=\lambda_{s}+2\mu_{s}$, $\lambda_{s}$ and $\mu_{s}$ are the
interface Lam\'{e} constants, and $\gamma_{0}$ is residual
interface stress.

The generalized Hooke's law for isotropic bulk material in the
case of plane strain has the form
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{hook}%3
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{nn}(z)=(\lambda_j+2\mu_j )\varepsilon_{nn}(z)+\lambda_j\varepsilon_{tt}(z),%\nonumber
\\ \\
\sigma_{tt}(z)=(\lambda_j+2\mu_j)\varepsilon_{tt}(z)+\lambda_j\varepsilon_{nn}(z), \quad \sigma_{nt}(z) = 2\mu_j\varepsilon_{nt}(z),
\\ \\
\sigma_{33}(z)=\displaystyle\frac{\lambda_j}{2 (\lambda_j+\mu_j)}\left[\sigma_{tt}(z)+\sigma_{nn}(z)\right],\quad z \in B_j,\quad j=\{1,2\},%\nonumber
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
here $\sigma_{nn},\sigma_{tt},\sigma_{nt}$ and $\varepsilon_{nn},\varepsilon_{tt},\varepsilon_{nt}$ are the components of bulk stress and strain tensors, respectively, defined in the local Cartesian coordinates $(n,t)$ ($n$ and $t$ are normal and tangential to the interface), and $\lambda_j$ and $\mu_j$ are the Lam\'{e} constants of the bulk phase $B_j$.

At infinity, the stresses $\sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ $(\alpha, \beta=\{1,2\})$ in the global coordinates $(x_{1}$, $x_{2})$ and the rotation angle $\omega$ are specified as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{inf}%4
\lim\limits_{{x_2}\to\pm\infty}\sigma_{22}=\lim\limits_{{x_2}\to\pm\infty}\sigma_{12}=\lim\limits_{{x_2}\to\pm\infty }\omega =0,\quad \lim\limits_{{x_2}\to\pm\infty }\sigma_{11}=\sigma^{0}_{j}, \quad j=\{1,2\}.
\end{equation}

The conditions of mechanical equilibrium of undulated interface
$S$ in the case of the simplified Gurtin---Murdoch constitutive
equations is represented in the terms of the generalized
Young---Laplace equation [8]:
\begin{equation}
\label{yl}%5
\Delta\sigma(\zeta)=\sigma^{+}(\zeta)-\sigma^{-}(\zeta) =-\kappa(\zeta)\sigma^{s}_{tt}(\zeta)+i\frac{1}{h(\zeta)}\frac {d\sigma^{s}_{tt}(\zeta)}{dx_1}, \quad \zeta\in S,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma(z)=\sigma_{nn}(z)+i\sigma_{nt}(z)$ is the stress complex vector and $\sigma^{\pm}=\lim\limits_{z\to\zeta\pm i0}\sigma(z)$, $\kappa$ and $h$  are the local principal curvature and metric coefficient on the curved interface $S$, respectively.

It is assumed that the interface layer is coherently connected with both bulk materials. As a result, the displacements are continuous at the interface
\begin{equation}
\label{cohesion}%6
\Delta u(\zeta)=u^{+}(\zeta)-u^{-}(\zeta)=0, \quad \zeta\in S,
\end{equation}

\noindent here $u=u_{1}+iu_{2}$ is a complex displacement vector,
$u^{\pm}=\lim\limits_{z\to\zeta\pm i0}u(z)$, $u_1$ and $u_2$ are
the displacements along axes of the Cartesian coordinates $(x_{1},
x_{2})$.

In order to minimize the total free energy, the interface shape can be rearrangement by diffusive mass transfer. It is assumed that mass transfer occurs by interface diffusion. The diffusion flux in phase $B_{j}$ along the interface is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential $\chi_{j}$ [1, 9]
\begin{equation}
\label{flux}%7
J_j( \zeta,\tau)=-\frac{D_{j}C_{j}}{k_{b}T}\frac{\partial\chi_j( \zeta,\tau)}{\partial s},
\end{equation}
where $D_{j}$ and $C_{j}$ are the interface self-diffusivity coefficient and the number of diffusion atoms of material per unit area, respectively, for the phase $B_{j}$; $k_{b}$ is the Boltzmann's constant;  $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The local chemical potential $\chi_j$ can be defined as free energy per unit of added volume [10]:
\begin{equation}
\label{potent}%8
\chi_j( \zeta,\tau)=\left[U_j( \zeta,\tau) +(-1)^{j+1}\kappa( \zeta,\tau) U_{s}( \zeta,\tau)\right]\Omega_j.
\end{equation}
\noindent In (\ref{potent})  $\Omega_j$ and $U_j$ are an atomic
volume and the strain energy density along the interface,
respectively, for material $B_j$,  $U_{s}$ is the interface energy
density. %\pagebreak

The atomic flux divergence along the interface gives the change of
interface profile $g(x_1,\tau)=\varepsilon(\tau) f(x_1)$ with time
which can be written in the form of non-linear evolution equation
[9]:
\begin{equation}
\label{Klinger}%9
\displaystyle\frac{\partial g(x_{1},\tau)}{\partial \tau}=h(\zeta,\tau)\frac{\partial }{\partial s}\left[\frac{ r}{ 1+r}J_1( \zeta,\tau)- \frac{1}{r+1}J_2( \zeta,\tau)\right],
\end{equation}
here $r=\mu_1/\mu_2$ is a stiffness ratio.


The diffusional fluxes $J_j$ are obtained from equation
(\ref{flux}) taking into account equa\-tion~(\ref{potent}):
\begin{equation}
\label{flow}%10
\displaystyle J_j( \zeta,\tau)=-K_{j}\frac{\partial }{\partial s}\left[ U_j( \zeta, \tau)+(-1)^{j+1}\kappa( \zeta,\tau)U_s(\zeta, \tau)\right], \quad K_{j}=\frac{D_{j}C_{j}\Omega_{j}}{k_{b}T}.
\end{equation}
%\vskip -4.9pt
\noindent It should be noted, that this approach is also applicable for describing the morphological changes at the surface and interface induced by the corrosion [11, 12] and the electrical current [13].

{\bf 3. Linear stability analysis.} Since only linear instability
of the interface $S$ is in\-ves\-ti\-ga\-ted, we seek the
components of stress and strain tensors of bulk and
surface/interface elasticity in the first-order approximation of
boundary perturbation method:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{bpm}%11
\Lambda(z,\tau)=\Lambda_{(0)}(z)+\varepsilon(\tau)\Lambda_{(1)}(z),\quad
\Lambda=\{\sigma_{nn},\sigma_{tt},\sigma_{nt},\varepsilon_{nn},\varepsilon_{tt},\varepsilon_{nt},\sigma^{s}_{tt},\varepsilon^{s}_{tt}\}.
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, the expressions for strain energy density along the
interface $U_{j}$ and interface energy density $U_{s}$ take the
form
\begin{equation}
\label{enrg}%12
\begin{array}{c}
U_{2}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma^{+}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon_{tt(0)}+\varepsilon\left[\sigma^{+}_{nn(1)}\varepsilon_{nn(0)}+\sigma^{+}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon_{tt(1)}+
\sigma^{+}_{tt(1)}\varepsilon_{tt(0)}\right]\right),
\\ \\
U_{2}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma^{-}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon_{tt(0)}+\varepsilon\left[\sigma^{-}_{nn(1)}\varepsilon_{nn(0)}+\sigma^{-}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon_{tt(1)}
+\sigma^{-}_{tt(1)}\varepsilon_{tt(0)}\right]\right),
\\ \\
U_{s}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma^{s}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon^{s}_{tt(0)}+\varepsilon\left[\sigma^{s}_{tt(1)}\varepsilon^{s}_{tt(0)}+\sigma^{s}_{tt(0)}
\varepsilon^{s}_{tt(1)}\right]\right).
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The linearization in the space of the parameter $\varepsilon$ for the metric coefficient $h$ and the local principal curvature $\kappa$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{lin}%13
\kappa(x_1,\tau)=\varepsilon(\tau)f^{\prime\prime}(x_1),\quad h(x_1,\tau)=1,
\end{equation}
here a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument.

Substituting  equations (\ref{flow})--(\ref{lin}) into equation~(\ref{Klinger}), we derive a linear ordinary differential equation that gives the amplitude change of interface perturbation with time:
\begin{equation}
\label{levol}%14
\begin{array}{c}
\displaystyle\frac{dA(\tau)}{d\tau}f(x_1)=\frac{A(\tau)}{2(1+r)}\frac{d^2}{dx^2_1}\left\{K_1r \left[\sigma^{+}_{nn(1)}\varepsilon_{nn(0)}+\sigma^{+}_{tt(0)}
\varepsilon_{tt(1)}(x_1)\,+\right.\right.
\\ \\
\displaystyle\left.+\,\sigma^{+}_{tt(1)}(x_1)\varepsilon_{tt(0)}+\varepsilon^{s}_{tt(0)}\sigma^{s}_{tt(0)}f^{\prime\prime}(x_1)\right] - K_2\left[\sigma^{-}_{nn(1)}
\varepsilon_{nn(0)}\,+\right.
\\ \\
\left.\left.  +\,\sigma^{-}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon_{tt(1)}(x_1)+\sigma^{-}_{tt(1)}(x_1)\varepsilon_{tt(0)}-\sigma^{s}_{tt(0)}\varepsilon^{s}_{tt(0)}f^{\prime\prime}(x_1)\right]\right\}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

After that, we have to define the components of stress and strain tensors for surface and bulk phases, which are included in the right-hand side of the differential equation. To this aim, we use the solution of the corresponding boundary value problem of plane elasticity (\ref{model})--(\ref{cohesion}), which is detailed in [14]. According to [14], the stress tensor components can be represented by Muskhelishvili's formula through Goursat---Kolosov complex potentials $\Phi_{j}$ and $\Upsilon_{j}$:

\begin{equation}%15
\label{mus}
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{nn}(z)+i\sigma_{tt}(z)=\Phi_{j}(z)+\overline{\Phi_{j}(z)}-\left[\Upsilon_{j}(\overline{z})+\overline{\Phi_{j}(z)}- \left(z-\overline{z}\right)\overline{\Phi_{j}^{\prime}(z)}
\right]e^{- 2i\alpha},
\\ \\
\sigma_{tt}(z)+\sigma_{nn}(z)=4{\rm Re}\Phi_{j}(z),\quad z\in B_{j},\quad j=\{1,2\},
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\Phi_{j}$, $\Upsilon_{1}$ and $\Upsilon_{2}$ are the functions holomorphic in $B_{i}$,  $\widetilde{B_{1}}=\left\{z:\,\,x_{2}>-\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\}$ and  $\widetilde{B_{2}}=\left\{z:\,\,x_{2}<-\varepsilon f(x_1)\right\}$, respectively, a bar over a symbol denotes the complex conjugation and $\alpha$ is the angle between axes $t$ and $x_{1}$.

According to (\ref{inf}), the values of the functions $\Phi_{j}$
and $\Upsilon_{j}$  at infinity are following:
\begin{displaymath}
\label{cpinf}%16
\lim\limits_{{x_2}\to-\infty}\Phi_{j}(z)=\lim\limits_{{x_2}\to+\infty}\Upsilon_{j}(z)=\sigma^{0}_{j}/4.
\end{displaymath}

The complex potentials  $\Phi_{j}$ and $\Upsilon_{j}$ in the first
order approximation can be written in the form
\begin{displaymath}
\label{ps}%17
\Phi_{j}(z)=\Phi_{j(0)}(z)+\varepsilon\Phi_{j(1)}(z),\quad\Upsilon_{j}(z)=\Upsilon_{j(0)}(z)+\varepsilon\Upsilon_{j(1)}(z).
\end{displaymath}


The boundary values of functions $\Phi_{j(m)}$, $\Upsilon_{j(m)}$
and $\sigma^s_{tt(m)}$ are expanded in the Taylor series in the
vicinity of the line $x_{2}=0$, considering the real variable
$x_{1}$ as a parameter. For the first-order approximation we can
write
\begin{displaymath}
\label{taylor}%18
\Psi_{(m)}(\zeta)=\Psi_{(m)}(x_{1})+i\varepsilon f(x_1)\Psi^{\prime}_{(m)}(x_{1}),\quad m=\{0,1\},
\end{displaymath}
here $\Psi_{(m)}$ could be any of the above-listed functions.

According to equality $\varepsilon f^{\prime}(x_1)={\rm tg}{\alpha}$, the following linearization of an exponential function can be written:
\begin{displaymath}
\label{exp}%19
e^{-2i\alpha}=1-2i\varepsilon f^{\prime}(x_1).
\end{displaymath}

Based on the solutions of the Riemann---Hilbert problems on the jumps of analytical functions at the line $x_{2}=0$, the complex potentials are obtained as it follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{pot}%20
\begin{array}{c}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\Phi_{1(m)}^{2}(z)=-\Upsilon_{2(m)}^{2}(z)+\Sigma_{m}(z)+O_{m}^{1}, & \mathop{\rm Im\,z} > 0, \\ \\
\Upsilon_{1(m)}^{2}(z)=-\Phi_{2(m)}^{2}(z)+\Sigma_{m}(z)+O_{m}^{1}, & \mathop{\rm Im\,z} < 0,
\end{array}\right.
\\
\\
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\Upsilon_{2(m)}^{2}(z)=\frac{\mu_{2}\varkappa_{1}\Sigma_{m}(z)+V_{m}(z)}{\mu_{1}+\mu_{2}\varkappa_{1}}+O_{m}^{2}, & \mathop{\rm Im\,z} > 0,\\ \\
\displaystyle\Phi_{2(m)}^{2}(z)=\frac{\mu_{2}\Sigma_{m}(z)-V_{m}(z)}{\mu_{2}+\mu_{1}\varkappa_{2}}+O_{m}^{2}, & \mathop{\rm Im\,z} < 0.
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
In this formula $ \displaystyle\Sigma_{m}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi
i}\!\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{i\sigma_{tt(m)}^{s\prime}(t)
}{z-t}dt+\frac{1}{2\pi
i}\!\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{1}(t)}{z-t}dt,\,\,
V_{m}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi
i}\!\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{2}(t)}{z-t}dt, $
$\varkappa_j=4\nu_{j}-3$, $\nu_{j}$ is the Poisson ratio of
elastic domain $B_{j}$, $O_{0}^{j}=\sigma^{0}_{j}/4$,\,
$O_{1}^{j}=0$, $F^{j}_{0}=0$,\, functions $F^{j}_{1}=0$ are known
and can be found in [14].

In the case of the zero-order approximation, we arrive to
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{zero}%21
\Phi_{j(0)}(z)=\Upsilon_{j(0)}(z)=\sigma^0_j/4,\quad \sigma^{s}_{tt(0)}(x_1)=\frac{M_s(\varkappa_2+1)\sigma^0_2}{8\mu_2}, \nonumber
\\ \nonumber\\
\sigma_{11(0)}(z)=\sigma^0_{j},\quad \sigma^0_{1}=\displaystyle\frac{\mu_{1}(\varkappa_{2}+1)}{\mu_{2}(\varkappa_{1}+1)}\sigma^0_{2},\quad z\in B_{j},\quad j=\{1,2\} \nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}

For the first-order approximation, the solution is derived in trigonometric form
\begin{displaymath}
\sigma^{s}_{tt(1)}=-D\cos{(bx_{1})},\quad D=\displaystyle\frac{2\pi M_{s}\left[R_1(1-r)\sigma_2^0-R_2\sigma^s_{tt(0)}b\right]}{2\mu_2+M_sR_1b},
\end{displaymath}
here  $R_1={\varkappa_1}/{(r+\varkappa_1)}+{\varkappa_2}/{(1+r\varkappa_2)}$, $R_2={\varkappa_1}/{(r+\varkappa_1)}-{\varkappa_2}/{(1+r\varkappa_2)}$.

The complex potentials can be found from equation~(\ref{pot}). After that, one can obtain the stress tensor components from equation~(\ref{mus}) as well as components of strain tensor from equation~(\ref{hook}). Taking into account the form of initial interface undulation and integrating linearized evolution equation (\ref{levol}) over the time, we obtain the governing equation which gives the exponential growth or decay of amplitude $A$ with time:
\begin{displaymath}
\label{eq34}
\ln\left(\displaystyle\frac{A(\tau)}{A_0}\right)=P(a, \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2,  \lambda_s, \mu_s, \gamma_0, K_1, K_2, \sigma_1^0, \sigma_2^0)\tau,
\end{displaymath}
where $P$ is a known function which depend on the physical and geometrical parameters of the problem.

The critical value of initial wavelength $a_{cr}$ corresponding to the state of equilibria could be found from the following equation:
\begin{displaymath}
%\label{eq35}
P(a, \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2,  \lambda_s, \mu_s, \gamma_0, K_1, K_2, \sigma_1^0,  \sigma_2^0)=0.
\end{displaymath}
Perturbations with wavelength below $a_{cr}$ are stable in the sense that they will be eliminated by diffusion, i. e. the amplitude of initial perturbation will be decreased with the time. %Perturbations with wavelength above $a_{cr}$ are unstable and the amplitude will be increased by diffusion.

To analyze the stability of curved interface in heteroepitaxial
system, we consider the aluminum substrate with the elastic
constants  $\lambda_2=58.17$ GPa and $\mu_2=26.13$ GPa covered by
an arbitrary metal coating with the shear modulus $\mu_1=r\mu_2$
and with the thickness that is much greater than the interface
undulation wavelength. Due to the fact that we consider the
metal-on-metal system,  the Poisson's ratios are assumed to be
equal $\nu_1 = \nu_2=0.345$. Figure 2 shows the dependence of
normalized amplitude change on perturbation wavelength for
$\gamma_0=1$~N/m, $\sigma_2^0=1$~GPa,  diffusion ratio
$K=K_1/K_2=1$ and different  stiffness ratios $r=\{0,0.1,0.3\}$.
The intersection of lines with abscissa gives the critical
wavelength values $a_{cr}$.



{\bf 4. Conclusion.} This paper contains the further development
of the theoretical methods for studying the formation of
topological defects on free and interfacial surfaces of composite
materials [5, 15]. Based on thermodynamics and solid mechanics
framework, we derived the equation which describes the change of
perturbation amplitude with time. Considering the metal-on-metal
interface, it was found that the critical perturbation wavelength
increases with increasing stiffness ratio $r$ and interface
stiffness $M_s$. The considered problem can be reduced to a
problem of morphological instability of stressed solid surface
presented in [15] by equating $r=0$. The solutions of both
problems are found to be in good agreement.
